         Introduction to
Jordan
Western travellers have been exploring the Middle East for 
well over a century, but Jordan is a relative newcomer to 
tourism, welcoming only a fraction of the numbers who visit 
neighbouring Egypt and Israel. The country's popular image 
abroad encompasses not much more than camels, deserts 
and bedouin, and there's little awareness of Jordan's 
mountains and beaches, its castles and ancient churches, 
the urbanity of its people and richness of its culture.
Jordan is largely desert, but this one bland word covers 
a multitude of scenes, from the dramatic red sands and 
towering cliffs of the far south to the vast stony plains 
of volcanic basalt in the east. The northern hills, rich 
with olive trees, teeter over the rift of the Jordan 
Valley, which in turn runs down to the Dead Sea, 
lowest point on earth. The centre of the country is 
carpeted with tranquil fields of wheat, cut through 
by expansive canyons and bordered by arid, craggy mountains. At the 
southernmost tip of the country, beaches fringe the warm waters of the 
Red Sea, which harbours some of the most spectacular coral reefs in 
the world.
Jordan is part of the land bridge linking Europe, Africa and Asia, and 
has seen countless armies come and go. Greeks, Romans, Muslims, 
Christian Crusaders and more have left evidence of their conquests, and 
there are literally thousands of ruins and archeological sites from all 
periods in every corner of the country. In addition, Israel and Palestine,

| INTRODUCTION | WHERE TO GO | WHEN TO GO
Jordan's neighbours to the west, have 
no monopoly on biblical history: it 
was in Jordan that Lot sought refuge 
from the fire and brimstone of the 
Lord; Moses, Aaron and John the 
Baptist all died in Jordan; and Jesus 
was almost certainly baptized here. 
Even the Prophet Muhammad passed 
through.
And yet the country is far from 
being stuck in the past. Amman is 
a thoroughly modern capital, and 
Jordan's respectable rate of economic 
growth means that grinding poverty 
is the rare exception rather than the 
rule. Kids may sell you gum or offer to 
shine your shoes, but you'll see more 
desperate begging in the streets of any 
European or North American city than 
anywhere in Jordan. Government is 
Fact file
s The Hashemite Kingdom 
of Jordan (in Arabic, 
al-Mamlakeh al-Urduniyyeh 
al-Hashmiyyeh, or al-Urdun)
covers an area of around 
92,000 square kilometres - a 
little more than Portugal and 
a little less than Indiana. 
About 85 percent is desert. 
The highest and lowest 
points are Jebel Umm 
ad-Daami (1834m) and the 
Dead Sea shore (408m below 
sea level).
sªWell over 90 percent of 
the population of around 
6.2 million are Muslim
Arabs, with small minori-
ties of Muslim Circassians
and Chechens, as well as 
Christian Arabs. Almost 38 
percent of the population is 
below the age of 15.
sªJordan is a constitutional 
monarchy, with universal 
suffrage over the age of 
20. The king appoints the 
Prime Minister and together 
they appoint the cabinet. 
In the bicameral National 
Assembly, the forty-member 
Senate is appointed by the 
king and the eighty-member 
House of Representatives 
voted in by proportional 
representation. The single 
biggest sector in the 
economy - traditionally 
dependent on phosphates 
and potash production - 
is now tourism, which 
generates thirteen percent 
of GDP.
sªThe average annual wage
in Jordan is around JD5000 
(US$7100).

stable, with leanings towards democracy under a constitutional monarchy, 
and manages to be simultaneously pro-Western, pro-Arab, founded on 
a bedrock of Muslim authority and dedicated to ongoing peace with 
Israel. Women are better integrated into positions of power in govern-
ment and business than almost anywhere else in the Middle East, military 
conscription has been abolished, and Jordanians are exceptionally highly 
educated: just over 2.5 percent of the total population is enrolled at 
university, a proportion comparable to the UK. Traditions of hospitality
are ingrained, and taking up some of the many invitations you'll get to 
tea or a meal will expose you to an outlook among local people that is 
often as cosmopolitan and world-aware as anything at home. Though 
surrounded by instability, Jordan is the safest country in the Middle East 
by quite a long way, and 
domestic 
extremism 
is 
virtually non-existent.
Most people take great 
pride in their ancestry, 
whether they're present 
or former desert-dwellers 
(bedouin) 
or 
from 
a 
settled farming tradition 
(fellahin). Across the desert 
areas, people still live and 
work on their tribal lands,

| INTRODUCTION | WHERE TO GO | WHEN TO GO
Jordan's ﬂag
Jordan's ﬂag is a source of national 
pride. It is adapted from the 
revolutionary banner of the Great 
Arab Revolt of 1916-17, when Arab 
armies led by the Hashemites - a 
noble dynasty, now led by King 
Abdullah II of Jordan, which traces 
its origins back to the Prophet 
Muhammad - overthrew the rule of 
the Ottoman Empire in the Middle 
East.
The ﬂag has three equal horizontal 
bands. At the top is black,
representing the Abbasid Caliphate
that ruled from Baghdad in the 
eighth and ninth centuries; in the 
middle is white, representing the 
Umayyad Caliphate that ruled 
from Damascus in the seventh 
and eighth centuries; and at the 
bottom is green, representing the Fatimid Caliphate that ruled from Cairo 
in the tenth and eleventh centuries. On the hoist side is a red triangle
representing the Great Arab Revolt of 1916-17. Within the triangle is 
a seven-pointed white star which symbolizes the seven verses of the 
opening sura (verse) of the Quran; the points represent faith in one God, 
humanity, national spirit, humility, social justice, virtue and hope.
whether together in villages or apart in individual family units; many 
town-dwellers, including substantial numbers of Ammanis, claim tribal 
identity. Belonging to a tribe (an honour conferred by birth) means 
respecting the authority of a communal leader, or sheikh, and living in a 
culture of shared history, values and principles that often crosses national 
boundaries. Notions of honour and mutual defence are strong. Tribes also 
wield a great deal of institutional power: most members of Jordan's lower 
house of parliament are elected for their tribal, rather than political, affili-
ation. The king, as sheikh of sheikhs, 
commands heartfelt loyalty among 
many people and deep respect among 
most of the rest.
National identity is a thorny issue 
in Jordan, which has taken in huge numbers of Palestinian refugees since 
the foundation of the State of Israel in 1948. Many people from tribes 
resident east of the River Jordan before 1948 resent this overbalancing of 
the country's demography, and the fact that incoming Palestinians, having

developed an urbanized, entrepreneurial culture, dominate private-sector 
business. For their part, Jordanians of Palestinian origin - estimated to 
make up as much as sixty percent of the population - often resent the "East 
Bank" Jordanians' grip on power in government and the public sector. All 
are Jordanian citizens, but citizenship tends to mean less to many of Pales-
tinian origin than their national identity, and less to many East Bankers than 
their tribal affiliation. Large numbers of long-stay guest workers from Egypt 
muddy the issue still further. "Where are you from?" - a simple enough 
question in most countries - is in Jordan the cue for a life story.
Where to go
J
ordan's prime attraction is Petra, an unforgettably dramatic 
2000-year-old city carved from sandstone cliffs in the south of the 
country. Its extraordinary architecture and powerful atmosphere 
imprint themselves indelibly on most visitors' imaginations.
There is a wealth of other historical sites, outstanding among them 
the well-preserved Roman city of Jerash, but also including Umm Qais, 
set on a dramatic promontory overlooking the Sea of Galilee, and Pella, 
where Jerusalem's Christians fled Roman persecution in the first century 
AD. Madaba, which became an important Christian town and regional

centre for mosaic art during the Byzantine period, houses the oldest known 
map of the Middle East, in the form of a large mosaic laid on the floor of 
a church. After the Muslim conquest, the Umayyad dynasty built a series 
of retreats in the Jordanian desert, now dubbed the "Desert Castles", 
including the bath-house of Qusayr Amra, adorned with naturalistic 
and erotic frescoes, and Qasr Harraneh, perhaps the most atmospheric 
ancient building in the country. Centuries later, the Crusaders established a 
heavy presence in southern Jordan, most impressively with the huge castles 
at Karak and Shobak. The Arab resistance to the Crusader invasion left 
behind a no less impressive castle at Ajloun in the north.
Jordan also counts as part of the "Holy Land" for its religious sites, 
most importantly the Baptism Site of Jesus on the banks of the 
River Jordan, and Mount Nebo, from where Moses looked over the 
Promised Land. John the Baptist met his death at Herod's hilltop palace 
at Mukawir after Salome danced her seductive dance. Nearby are 
The search for water
Jordan is among the ten 
most water-poor countries 
in the world. Annual 
consumption per capita 
(calculated as renewable 
water resources withdrawn) 
is about 170 cubic metres, 
compared with 630 as the 
world average, 800 across 
the Middle East/North Africa 
region - and 1,650 in North 
America. Almost a third of 
the water used in Jordan 
comes from non-sustainable 
or non-renewable sources. 
Three decades of pumping 
from the once-abundant 
Azraq oasis (see p.209) has brought it to the point of collapse. A 
major tributary of the River Jordan, the Yarmouk, sports a large dam 
shared by Jordan and Syria, and all the major valleys leading down to 
the Dead Sea are now dammed in an effort to stop water draining into 
the salty lake (which has contributed to its rapid shrinking; see p.131). 
Every winter the local newspapers publish reports tabulating levels of 
water storage in the country's reservoirs, while Jordanians anxiously 
wait for rain. Water rationing is in place in Amman over the summer. 
it is hoped that schemes to pipe water from desert aquifers and to 
construct shared desalination plants on the Red Sea will alleviate the 
problem. Time will tell.

Bab adh-Dhraa, one of the 
leading contenders for the 
site of biblical Sodom, and 
Lot's Cave, where Abraham's 
nephew sought refuge from 
the destruction of Sodom and 
Gomorrah. Most of these, and 
other sites such as the tomb 
of Aaron at Petra, are holy to 
Muslims, Jews and Christians 
alike, while there are also 
plenty of specifically Muslim 
sites, including a holy tree in 
the desert at Biqya'wiyya, 
said to have sheltered the 
Prophet Muhammad himself, 
and literally dozens of shrines 
and tombs in every corner of 
the country.
Your most abiding memories 
of a visit are likely to be of 
Jordan's varied and beautiful natural environment. With its sheer cliffs 
and red sands, austere Wadi Rum - where David Lean filmed Lawrence 
of Arabia - presents the classic desert picture of Jordan, and is the starting 
point for camel treks of anything from an hour to a week. Less well-known 
are the gentle northern hills around the Ajloun forests, hosting walks 
through flower-strewn meadows and cool, shady woodland. In the south, 
the tranquil Dana Nature Reserve encompasses a swathe of territory 
from verdant highland orchards down to the sandy desert floor, and offers 
Transliterating Arabic 
Many sounds in Arabic have no equivalent in English, and any attempt 
to render them in English script is bound to be imprecise. Place names 
are the biggest sources of confusion, varying from map to map and 
often from sign to sign - you'll see roadsigns to Wadi Seer, Wadi El 
Sseir, Wadi Alsear and Wadi as-Sir, all referring to the same place. In 
this book we've tried to stick to a phonetically helpful, common-sense 
system, while also staying close to existing English renderings. The 
deﬁnite article "al" and its variations have been removed from all place 
names other than compound ones: Al-Aqaba, Ar-Ramtha and As-Salt 
have all been shortened (Aqaba, Ramtha, Salt), but Umm al-Jimal and 
Shuneh al-Janubiyyeh stay as they are. For more on the intricacies of 
Arabic, see p.407.

extensive opportunities for bird- and wildlife-spotting. The protected 
Wadi Mujib is a giant canyon, 4km wide at the top, that narrows to a high, 
rocky gorge carrying a fast-flowing river down to the salty Dead Sea, an 
inland lake too buoyant for swimming but perfect for floating, your body 
supported by the density of the salty water. Last but not least, Jordan has 
some of the world's best diving and snorkelling in the coral-fringed Red 
Sea off Aqaba.
When to go
D
espite the small size of the country, you'll find wide variations in 
climate whenever you arrive, often because of the topography: 
Amman, Petra and Wadi Rum all lie well over 800m above sea 
level, Dana and Ajloun are even higher (up to 1500m), whereas 
the Dead Sea lies 400m below sea level. The same January day could have 
you throwing snowballs in Ajloun or topping up your tan on the Red Sea 
beaches at Aqaba.
The best time to visit is spring (March-May), when temperatures are 
toasty but not scorching, wildflowers are out everywhere (even the desert is 
carpeted), and the hills and valleys running down the centre of the country

are lush and gorgeously colourful. The worst of the rain is over by March, 
though it doesn't entirely peter out in Amman and the hills until late April. 
Humidity is pleasant everywhere, and low, clear sunlight draws a spectacular 
kaleidoscope of colour and texture from the desert rocks. There's only one 
drawback - a desert wind, loaded with dust and grit, which blows regularly 
each spring or early summer 
out of the Arabian interior. It's 
known across the Middle East as 
the khamseen ("fifty"), after the 
fifty days it traditionally persists (although in Jordan it rarely lasts longer 
than a few days), and can darken the sky and raise the temperature by 10°C, 
coating everyone and everything in a layer of sand.
In summer (roughly June-Sept), Amman can sizzle - up to 40°C in 
the city centre - and you'll find little respite in the rest of the country, 
although the hills around Ajloun catch some cooler breezes. Temperatures 
at the Dead Sea and Aqaba have been known to top 50°C, with Aqaba in 
particular suffering from an intolerable hot wind that makes you feel like 
you're basting in a fan-assisted oven. High, hazy light flattens the brown 
landscape and bleaches any beauty out of the desert, and you'll find it's too 
uncomfortably hot countrywide to do any walking or sightseeing between 
noon and 4pm. 
Typical autumn weather (mid-Sept to mid-Nov) mostly passes Jordan 
by, with only a few weeks marking the shift out of high summer - if you

catch it, this can be a lovely time to visit. The first rains fall in early or 
mid-October, making the parched countryside bloom again and the torrid 
temperatures drop to more manageable levels.
In winter (roughly Dec-Feb), Amman can be desperately chilly, with 
biting winds sweeping through the valleys, rain showers and even snowfall, 
although the sun is still never far away. With short days and freezing nights, 
Petra winters can be taxing; exceptional lows of -8°C have been recorded. 
Rum is more temperate, but Aqaba is the only retreat, with sunshine and 
warmth even in the depths of January (average Red Sea and Dead Sea water 
temperatures vary little either side of a balmy 24°C all year).

things not to miss
It's not possible to see everything that Jordan has to offer in one 
trip - and we don't suggest you try. What follows is a selective 
and subjective taste of the country's highlights: outstanding 
natural landscapes, ancient ruins, outdoor activities and the 
spectacular site of Petra. They're arranged in five colour-coded 
categories to help you find the very best things to see, do and 
experience. All entries have a page reference to take you straight 
into the Guide, where you can find out more.

Queen Alia International Airport in Amman
(AMM) handles almost all incoming ﬂights to 
Jordan. Some charter ﬂights come into 
Aqaba (AQJ), which is linked to Amman by 
daily short-hop shuttles on the national 
carrier Royal Jordanian.
When to travel
The best times to visit Jordan, weather-
wise, are spring (March-May) and autumn 
(Sept & Oct), but this is also when air fares 
and package deals are at their most 
expensive. Winter, when fares are lower, can 
be too chilly for comfortable sightseeing - 
and in summer you face the disadvantages 
of extreme heat and the peak season for 
tourism from the Gulf countries (as well as 
the holy month of fasting, Ramadan, which 
falls in July and/or Aug each year until 2015).
Air 
fares 
also 
peak 
in 
the 
periods 
surrounding major Islamic holidays such as 
Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha (see p.396), when 
thousands - or, in the case of the hajj 
pilgrimage to Mecca, millions - of people are 
on the move. For weeks before the hajj (which 
takes place in Nov until 2011, then Oct in 
2012-14), whole planes get block-booked for 
pilgrims on many routes into the Middle East - 
not just ﬂights into Saudi Arabia, but also 
connections via Jordan and neighbouring 
countries. For two weeks after the pilgrimage, 
few planes out of the region have spare 
capacity. It pays to check when Islamic 
holidays are due to fall (see p.70); book well 
ahead if you want to ﬂy at or near those times.
One thing to watch when planning an 
itinerary is your scheduled arrival time:
many ﬂights from London, for instance, are 
afternoon departures, landing in Amman in 
the late evening - which means your head 
may not actually hit the pillow until midnight 
or later. In addition, many return ﬂights to 
London take off from Amman at breakfast 
time, necessitating a pre-dawn wake-up call. 
This means that UK visitors can "lose" a day 
at either end of their holiday.
Flights from the UK and 
Ireland
Flying to Amman from London Heathrow 
there is a choice of daily nonstop services on 
bmi and Royal Jordanian. Low-season return 
fares on bmi are around £400-450 (RJ are 
slightly pricier) - though frequent offers and 
seat sales can knock £100 off. In high 
season add £50-100. Flight time is 5 hours.
Bmi is also a good choice if you're starting 
from elsewhere in the UK: it has shuttle 
ﬂights into Heathrow from Manchester, 
Glasgow, Belfast and elsewhere. Turkish 
Airlines has competitive fares from Stansted 
and Manchester to Amman via Istanbul; 
Cyprus Airways ﬂies cheaply from Heathrow 
and Stansted via Larnaca; or check out 
Malev from Gatwick via Budapest. Air 
France ﬂies from airports around the UK to 
Amman via Paris, but at a premium.
Charter ﬂights - generally Gatwick to
Aqaba - can be a bargain: you could get a 
return ﬂight plus seven nights' accommoda-
tion for £500-600, often much less if you 
book last-minute. Such packages are adver-
tised widely in newspaper travel sections.
From Dublin, bmi has good fares via 
Heathrow - around €500 return in low 
season (add €150 or so in high season), 
Getting there
Jordan is served by daily nonstop ﬂights from London and easy one-stop connec-
tions from around the UK, as well as nonstop routings from major European, North 
American and Southeast Asian hubs.
BASICS | Getting there
As this book went to press there was 
talk of boosting ﬂight links between 
the UK and Jordan. By the time you 
come to research your trip, you may 
ﬁnd a greater choice of airlines and 
routes than is shown here - along 
with, perhaps, lower fares. Check 
online or contact the Jordan Tourism 
Board (see p.71) for the latest info.

matched by Malev via Budapest. Air France 
via Paris, Turkish via Istanbul and Lufthansa 
via Frankfurt are other, often pricier options.

Six steps to a better kind of travel 
At Rough Guides we are passionately committed to travel. We feel strongly that only 
through travelling do we truly come to understand the world we live in and the people 
we share it with - plus tourism has brought a great deal of beneﬁt to developing 
economies around the world over the last few decades. But the extraordinary growth 
in tourism has also damaged some places irreparably, and of course climate change
is exacerbated by most forms of transport, especially ﬂying. This means that now 
more than ever it's important to travel thoughtfully and responsibly, with respect for 
the cultures you're visiting - not only to derive the most beneﬁt from your trip but 
also to preserve the best bits of the planet for everyone to enjoy. At Rough Guides 
we feel there are six main areas in which you can make a difference:
t$POTJEFSXIBUZPVSFDPOUSJCVUJOHUPUIFlocal economy, and how much the 
services you use do the same, whether it's through employing local workers and 
guides or sourcing locally grown produce and local services. 
t$POTJEFSUIFenvironment on holiday as well as at home. Water is scarce in 
many developing destinations, and the biodiversity of local ﬂora and fauna can 
be adversely affected by tourism. Try to patronize businesses that take account 
of this.

devoted to combating the effects of climate change.

Delta also ﬂies direct to Amman from JFK 
(either nonstop or via Paris), with numerous 
options from around the US. United offer 
good connections with European airlines such 
as bmi (at London) and Lufthansa (at 
Frankfurt), while British Airways, Air Canada 
and others can also ﬂy you from major cities 
with 
a 
change 
of 
plane 
(sometimes 
codesharing with other airlines). Turkish 
Airlines ﬂies Chicago or New York nonstop to 
Istanbul, with a shuttle on to Amman; EgyptAir 
does the same from JFK via Cairo.
Expect a round-trip fare in high season of 
around US$1000-1400 from the east and 
Midwest, US$1600-2000 from the west, 
and C$1100-1800 out of Canada. All these 
drop slightly in low season. Flight time is 
eleven hours from the East Coast or ﬁfteen 
hours from the West Coast, not including 
stops on the ground.

Organized tours
Many organized tours follow a fairly similar 
pattern - a week or so in Jordan, comprising 
stays in Amman, Petra, Aqaba and/or the 
Dead Sea, with sightseeing on the way and 
excursions to sites like Jerash and Wadi 
Rum. The advantage of these packages is 
that they get you a good-value ﬂight-plus-
accommodation deal; by booking a tour in 
advance you can end up staying in posh 
hotels for bargain prices. The disadvantage, 
of course, becomes clear if you fancy an 
extra day or two on your own to explore 
Petra once you get there.
Where ﬁxing up an organized tour really 
comes into its own is if you have a particular 
kind of holiday in mind. If you want to know 
all about Jordan's archeological sites, learn 
how to scuba-dive, or if you have your heart 
set on seeing a Sinai roseﬁnch (Jordan's 
national bird), specialist tour operators can 
sell you ready-made packages or tailor-
make a tour to suit your requirements. 
Adventure companies can often throw in 
activities such as camel-trekking, desert 
camping or snorkelling, and many operators 
specialize in pilgrimage tours to sites of 
biblical interest. You can also arrange tours 
directly with specialist tour companies in 
Jordan.

Travel from neighbouring 
countries
Many independent travellers arrive in Jordan on an overland odyssey between 
Istanbul and Cairo. Border crossings are straightforward, and most nationalities 
can get a Jordanian visa on arrival (except at the King Hussein/Allenby Bridge 
between Jerusalem and Amman).
From Damascus
The easiest way to get to Amman from the 
Syrian capital Damascus, barely 100km 
north of the Jordanian frontier, is by 
serveece, or shared taxi. They depart day 
and night from the Sumriyeh (Somaria) 
garage in western Damascus, for S£700 
(JD11) per seat. It's common for individuals 
to buy two seats (or couples to buy three) to 
give a roomier ride - or you can charter the 
whole car (usually four or ﬁve seats). There 
are 24-hour banks at the border. The usual 
terminus in Amman is Abdali, but for a little 
bit extra the driver will drop you off anywhere 
you want. Journey time is about three hours.

3pm. The fare is around US$11 or JD8 or 
S£600. Reckon on a journey time of four 
hours, since everyone must clear customs 
and immigration before the bus can carry on 
(which is one reason to go by serveece 
instead). Buses terminate next to the JETT 
External Lines ofﬁce, in the Abdali district. It's 
wise to book seats one day ahead. Extra 
buses are laid on in the peak summer season.
At the time of writing, there was no 
passenger service between Damascus and 
Amman on the historic Hejaz railway line. 
Flying takes longer than driving.
From Jerusalem
No public transport runs directly between 
Jerusalem and Amman: the only way to go is 
with a combination of bus, taxi and/or 
serveece. All trafﬁc is funnelled towards the 
single border crossing open to the public 
(Sun-Thurs 8am-4.30pm, Fri & Sat 8am-3pm; 
T02 548 2600), known to the Palestinians 
and Israelis as the Allenby Bridge (Jissr 
Allenby in Arabic; Gesher Allenby in Hebrew), 
but to the Jordanians as the King Hussein 
Bridge (Jissr al-Malek Hussein). On a good 
day, the journey can take as little as two

exit stamps from the border-posts at the Sheikh Hussein/Jordan River Bridge, the 
King Hussein/Allenby Bridge and the Wadi Araba/Yitzhak Rabin crossing (Aqaba-
Eilat), as well as Egyptian stamps from the border-posts at Taba (near Eilat) and 
Rafah in northern Sinai. Visas issued in Israel for travel to any country and ﬂight 
itineraries that specify Tel Aviv (or TLV) will also bar you, as will anything in Hebrew 
discovered in your belongings.
That said, we've had reports of travellers holding Israeli stamps getting into certain 
countries (Tunisia, Oman and the UAE, among others) without any difﬁculty, but this 
can't be relied upon. Syrian and Lebanese ofﬁcials are the least ﬂexible in this 
regard.
The best advice is to construct your itinerary so that you visit Israel last, after 
Syria and the rest. Alternatively, you can apply in your home country, well in 
advance, for a second passport: many countries issue these to people travelling

your tally of entry and exit stamps in each passport adds up, and that you don't 
hand the wrong passport over to the wrong border ofﬁcial.
If you hold only one passport, there is no foolproof method of avoiding a giveaway 
stamp. If you're feeling lucky, and you've entered Jordan by air, sea or across the 
land borders from Syria, Iraq or Saudi Arabia, then you could try using only the King 
Hussein (Allenby) Bridge to cross from Jordan to the West Bank and back (while 
making sure that your Jordanian visa does not expire in the meantime). At this 
bridge Israeli and Jordanian immigration ofﬁcials will usually stamp you both in and 
out on a piece of paper if you ask, thus avoiding any permanent evidence of having 
CFFOiPOUIFPUIFSTJEFw	BTNBOZUSBWFMMFSTSFGFSUP*TSBFMUPBWPJEEFUFDUJPOCZ
eavesdropping ofﬁcials). However, the success of this depends on not running into 
an ofﬁcial who decides to stamp your passport regardless.
It's a well-known ploy of travellers who have unwittingly acquired evidence of an 
Israeli visit to lose their passports deliberately in Egypt or Jordan and apply for 
new ones from their embassies. However, an unused passport issued in Cairo or 
"NNBOJTBTNVDIFWJEFODFUP4ZSJBODPOTVMBSPGmDJBMTPGBWJTJUUPi0DDVQJFE

loss of your old passport was genuine, you may still ﬁnd yourself refused entry to 
Syria on this suspicion.

hours; on a bad day, it can be more than ﬁve. 
This crossing-point is also notoriously subject 
to the ebb and ﬂow of Middle Eastern politics, 
and can close at short notice.
Although you must have a visa to enter 
Jordan, they are not issued at this bridge - 
which, thanks to a complex piece of ofﬁcial 
doublethink, is not viewed by Jordan as an 
international border (no Jordanian ﬂags ﬂy 
over it). If you try to cross without already 
holding a Jordanian visa, you'll be turned 
back by Israeli passport control.
Israeli buses from West Jerusalem don't 
go to the bridge. Instead, use the serveeces 
(shared taxis) departing frequently from East
Jerusalem for around NIS35 per person, run 
by Abdo travel agency opposite Damascus 
Gate (T02 628 3281). Set out early in the 
morning, or book your ride in advance: by 
about midday, when serveeces stop running, 
your only certain option is a taxi for around 
NIS180. Buses also run to the bridge from 
Jericho and other West Bank cities.
Within the bridge terminal, you must pay an 
Israeli departure tax, currently NIS157 
(around US$42). If you intend using your 
passport for overland travel beyond Jordan, 
be sure to tell the Israeli ofﬁcials to stamp the 
loose immigration forms only - not your 
passport. A bus (JD4) makes the short trip 
across the bridge to the Jordanian arrivals 
terminal. Serveeces do the one-hour journey 
direct to Tabarbour station in Amman (JD6 per 
person) or you could take a taxi (about JD30).
From Tel Aviv and 
Nazareth
Buses of Trust International Transport run 
regularly from the Israeli cities of Tel Aviv and 
Nazareth direct to Irbid and Amman. From 
Tel Aviv, buses depart from the Central Bus 
Station (Sun-Fri 2pm; NIS180; T050 553 
8762). From Lower Nazareth, departures are 
from the Trust ofﬁce (daily 3.30pm; NIS160; 
T04 646 6660). These two buses - which 
avoid passing through the West Bank - meet 
at a bridge over the River Jordan about 6km 
east of Bet She'an (Beisan in Arabic), known 
to the Israelis as the Jordan River crossing
(Sun-Thurs 6.30am-9pm, Fri & Sat 8am-
8pm; T04 609 3400), and to the Jordanians 
as the Sheikh Hussein Bridge or simply the 
Northern Crossing. You pay an Israeli 
departure 
tax, 
currently 
NIS90 
(about 
US$23), plus around NIS5 for a bus across 
the bridge. On the Jordanian side, after 
buying a visa (JD10), all passengers board a 
waiting bus which sets off for Irbid (dropping 
off at the Trust ofﬁce near Safeway) and on 
to Amman, terminating at the Trust ofﬁce 
near 7th Circle. Reckon on 5 hours end to 
end - and always book one day in advance.
You can also cross independently, with a 
taxi from Bet She'an to the bridge (around 
NIS25) and another taxi to Irbid (around 
JD25) or Amman (around JD50). Alternatively 
book with an Israeli travel agency: Mazada 
Tours (T03 544 4454, Wwww.mazadatours
.com) operates daily trips on request from 
Tel Aviv to Amman via this bridge, for around 
US$150 including border taxes and visa.
Flying from Tel Aviv to Amman - at the 
time of writing only possible on Royal 
Jordanian (T03 516 5566, Wwww.rj.com), 
at around US$240 one-way - offers the lure 
of spectacular scenery over desert hills and 
the Dead Sea. Flight time is about thirty 
minutes.
From Eilat
Another crossing-point from Israel is in the 
south, between the neighbouring Red Sea 
resort cities of Eilat (Israel) and Aqaba 
(Jordan), known to the Israelis as the Yitzhak 
Rabin or Arava crossing (Sun-Thurs 
6.30am-8pm, Fri & Sat 8am-8pm; T08 630 
0555), and to the Jordanians as the Wadi 
Araba or Southern crossing. From Eilat bus 
station, it's reached most easily by taking a 
taxi (around NIS40) or by simply walking 2km 
to the border. There's an Israeli departure 
tax, currently NIS90 (about US$23). Once 
you're through the formalities (note the tip on 
p.65 regarding free Jordanian visas at this 
crossing), a serveece into central Aqaba 
(5km) costs about JD3 per person, a taxi 
about JD12.
Details of fees, regulations and 
transport for crossing into Jordan via 
the King Hussein/Allenby Bridge, the 
Sheikh Hussein/Jordan River Bridge 
and the Rabin/Wadi Araba border are 
given at the Israel Airports Authority 
site Wwww.iaa.gov.il.

From Cairo and the Sinai
Buses do run from Cairo to Amman, though 
it's an uncomfortable journey of at least 20 
hours. 
Jordanian 
JETT 
and 
Egyptian 
SuperJet buses run twice weekly from the 
Almaza terminal in Heliopolis (T02 2290 
9013). The East Delta bus company runs four 
weekly services from the Sinai terminal in 
Abbassiya. The fare on either is around 
US$90-110 including the Nuweiba-Aqaba 
ferry, payable in dollars only. Royal Jordanian 
and EgyptAir ﬂy from Cairo to Amman 
(around US$240; ﬂight time 1hr 30min). RJ 
also ﬂies from Sharm el-Sheikh (around 
US$200).
There are two ferry services from the Sinai 
coast to Aqaba. Arab Bridge Maritime
(Cairo T02 2262 0036, Nuweiba T069 352 
0472;
Wwww.abmaritime.com.jo) 
runs 
boats 
from 
Nuweiba 
- 
though 
their 
timetable is notoriously unreliable and can 
change from month to month. Expect 
lengthy delays: six hours is not uncommon. 
At the time of writing, a catamaran departs 
daily at 1pm (economy US$70; ﬁrst class 
US$90; 1hr), and a slow ferry departs daily 
at midnight (US$65; 3hr). There's a tax of 
E£50. Arrive at the port, 8km south of 
Nuweiba, at least 2 hours early to buy 
tickets (with US dollars only). On boarding, 
you'll have to hand over your passport, 
which will be returned to you at Aqaba 
passport control (see p.65 for info about 
Aqaba visas). A serveece into central Aqaba 
(9km) is JD1.50 per person, a taxi JD6. 
Check for details of extra departures in peak 
season (during summer, at the end of 
Ramadan, and around the hajj and Eid 
al-Adha).
An alternative ferry runs from the marina at 
Taba Heights, 70km north of Nuweiba. It is 
designed as a cruise for people staying at 
Taba's 
luxury 
hotels, 
but 
qualiﬁes 
as 
passenger transport. There are departures 
daily at around 7.30am and 8.30am to Tala 
Bay, 15km south of Aqaba (a taxi into the 
city is about JD9), as well as a boat most 
days at noon or 1pm which docks at the 
giant ﬂagpole in central Aqaba. Passports are 
checked on arrival (see p.65 for info about 
Aqaba visas). The one-way fare is around 
US$70, which includes taxes and marina 
fees for non-hotel guests; the trip takes 30 
minutes. It is operated by the Jordanian 
company Sindbad: for details, contact their 
Egyptian agent Pro Tours (Cairo T02 3303 
8487, Taba T069 358 0076; Wwww
.protourstravel.com), or any of the Taba 
Heights hotels. You must book at least one 
day in advance.
It's cheaper and often easier to go 
overland through the Israeli resort of Eilat. 
Taba, on the Egyptian-Israeli border, is well 
served by transport from Nuweiba, Dahab 
and Cairo. The crossing is open 24 hours 
daily, but it's difﬁcult to ﬁnd transport inside 
Israel during the Jewish shabbat, so avoid 
making the trip between 2pm Friday and 
8pm Saturday. There's a small Egyptian 
departure tax (around E£50), and most 
nationalities are routinely issued with a free 
Israeli visa on arrival. Once in Israel, a combi-
nation of city buses and walking will get you 
to the Jordanian border (hagvul ha-yardeni in
Hebrew), but it's easier to take a taxi (around 
NIS80-100). For details about crossing into 
Jordan, see "From Eilat" above. Total journey 
time is about two or three hours - though 
the passport stamps you pick up will 
disqualify you from subsequently entering 
Syria and many other Middle Eastern 
countries.

BASICS | Getting around
Buses and serveeces
The most common way of getting between 
cities is by bus, most of which are ﬁfteen- 
or eighteen-seater minibuses. Some larger 
buses and air-conditioned coaches also 
serve as public transport. Throughout this 
book, we've used "bus" as a catch-all term, 
though in most cases minibuses are the 
only transport option available. Few timeta-
bles are in operation: buses tend to depart 
only when they're full. This means that, on 
less-travelled routes especially, you should 
factor in sometimes quite considerable 
waiting time for the bus to ﬁll up. Once you 
get going journeys are rarely arduous: roads 
are good, and the longest single journey in 
the country, from Amman to Aqaba, is 
unlikely to take more than four hours. All 
buses and minibuses have their point of 
origin and destination painted in Arabic 
script just above either brake-light on the 
rear of the vehicle.
Bus fares are very low. As a guide, a half-
hour hop between towns costs JD0.30-0.40 
one-way. Slightly longer journeys, such as 
Amman to Jerash, or Karak to Taﬁleh, are in 
the order of JD0.80-1. Rip-offs are rare: if 
you ask the fare, you'll invariably be told the 
truth. Expect inﬂated fares on routes serving 
major tourist sites: Petra to Wadi Rum is 
JD5. There is no competition between 
minibus operators.
A few companies operate large, air-con 
buses in competition with the minibuses on 
some long-distance runs. Jordan Express 
Tourist Transport, or JETT, has daily timeta-
bled services Amman-Aqaba and Amman-
Petra; Trust International Transport operates 
Amman-Aqaba and Irbid-Aqaba; Hijazi 
operates Amman-Irbid, mainly for Yarmouk 
University students; and there are a few 
others. These all offer the advantages of 
comfort and speed over the minibuses, and 
most allow you to book in advance (in 
person only, at the company's ofﬁce).
On most inter-city routes, shared taxis 
(universally known as serveeces) tout for 
business alongside the buses. These are 
white cars, often seating seven or eight 
people, which offer, at a slightly higher price, 
the single advantage of speed over the same 
journey by bus - though being squashed 
into the back seat on a long journey can 
counter in discomfort what might be gained 
in time. Serveeces also operate the system 
of departing when full, but because there are 
fewer seats they leave more frequently. If 
you're carrying bulky or heavy luggage, you 
may ﬁnd that serveece, and some minibus, 
drivers will charge you a small supplement 
per bag.
For getting around within cities, most 
places have their own systems of short-hop 
buses and serveeces.
Bus and serveece etiquette says that men 
should sit next to men and women next to 
women (except for married partners or 
siblings), and you should stick to this rule 
when you can. No one will be mortally 
offended if circumstances force you to sit 
next to a Jordanian of the opposite sex, but 
you may ﬁnd that other passengers shufﬂe 
themselves around before departure to avoid 
this happening.
Hitchhiking
Hitching a ride on well-travelled routes such 
as Amman to Petra will likely take you hours 
(or days), since drivers won't have a clue 
why you can't just get the bus like everyone 
Getting around
Jordan's public transport is a hotchpotch. Bus routes cover what's necessary for 
the locals, and there is little or no provision for independent travellers. With some 
highly visitable places inaccessible by public transport, the best way to see the 
whole of Jordan is to rent a car for at least part of your stay.
An explanation of Jordan's money is 
on p.69.

else. However, in areas where buses may be 
sporadic or nonexistent - the eastern 
desert, the southern portions of the King's 
Highway, the link road from the Desert 
Highway into Wadi Rum, or just from one 
village to the next on quiet country roads - 
local drivers stick to a well-established 
countryside protocol about picking people 
up if they have space. The way to show 
you're hitching is to hold out your arm and 
loosely ﬂap your index ﬁnger.
The ﬁrst rule - apart from foreign women 
never hitching alone - is that you should 
always be prepared to pay something, even 
if your money is refused when offered. Trying 
to freebie your way around the country will 
inspire contempt rather than camaraderie. 
Travellers who decide to hitch should do so 
always in pairs. The risk of unpleasantness is 
minuscule but nonetheless does exist; 
women should never sit next to men, and 
spontaneous offers of hospitality should be 
accepted only with extreme caution. Water
and a hat are vital accoutrements: dehydra-
tion is probably the greatest threat.
Driving
Compared with Egypt or Syria, driving in 
Jordan is a breeze; compared with the West, 
it's a challenge. Apart from driving on the 
right and always obeying a policeman, rules
of the road tend to have individual interpre-
tations. Most roads aren't marked out in 
lanes, so overtaking on both sides is normal 
- always accompanied by a blast or two on 
the horn - as is pulling out into fast-moving 
trafﬁc without looking. There is no universally 
accepted pattern of right of way. It's wise to 
follow the locals and sound your horn before 
many types of manoeuvre; out in the sticks, 
look out for kids playing on the hard shoulder 
and give a warning honk from a long way 
back. Trafﬁc lights are always respected - 
cameras record red-light runners - as are 
most one-ways. Right of way on rounda-
bouts goes to whoever's moving fastest.
Road 
surfaces 
are 
generally 
good, 
although there are lots of unmarked speed 
bumps and rumble strips in unexpected 
places (including main highways), as well as 
killer potholes. Look out for drifting sand in 
the desert: if you're going too fast when you 
hit a patch of sand, you can be spun off the 
road before you know it. Speed limits - 
posted regularly - are generally 100kph on 
highways and 90kph on main roads, 
dropping to 60kph or 40kph in built-up 
areas. Mobile police radar traps catch 
speeders, with spot ﬁnes around JD25.
On major roads, directional signs are 
plentiful and informative; most have English 
as well as Arabic. Large brown signs around 
the country direct tourists to major sites, 
superseding older blue signs. On unsigned 
back roads, the only fail-safe method of 
ﬁnding the right direction is to keep asking 
the locals.
Night driving is considerably more scary. 
Lighting is often poor, so speed bumps, 
uneven road surfaces, children or animals (or 
objects) in the road and potholes all become 
invisible. Slow-moving trucks and farm 
vehicles often chug along in the dark without 
lights or reﬂectors. It's common - if inexpli-
cable - practice on dark country roads to ﬂip 
to main beam when you see somebody 
coming, dazzling them blind. Many people 
ﬂash their headlights to say "get out of the 
way", but some do it to say "OK go ahead", 
others merely to say hello: you must make 
up your own mind at the time which it is.
Although a normal driving licence from 
home is sufﬁcient, an International Driving 
Permit can be useful, since it has an Arabic 
translation; these are available very inexpen-
sively from motoring organizations in your 
home country.
Renting a self-drive car
For reaching all corners of the country at 
your own pace, a rental car is a worthwhile 
- sometimes essential - investment, best 
arranged before you arrive. The rental market 
is huge, but most local ﬁrms cater more to 
Jordanians' friends and family than to 
Westerners - although you can get unearth 
some great deals on the ﬂy, many of these 
tiny outﬁts are no more than a guy with a 
phone renting out old cars on the cheap with 
no insurance, no papers and no service.
Amman has roughly 120 car rental ﬁrms, 
all of which can match or undercut the inter-
national agencies' rates - but few of which 
maintain equivalent levels of quality and 
service. The best-value and most conscien-
tious outﬁt is Reliable, located in Abdoun,

drop for longer rental periods. They'll bring 
the car to you, and you can drop it off for 
free, at the airport or anywhere in Amman, 
24 hours a day - and their customer service 
is excellent. Collision damage waiver (CDW) 
costs a few dinars more, but is worth it. 
Options such as theft protection (TP) are 
unnecessary.
Cheaper deals are available elsewhere (as 
low as JD15-20/day) - but this will buy you 
an older vehicle, dodgier paperwork and less 
reliable backup when you're out on the road.
The global names have broader coverage 
(and higher prices). Hertz (T06 553 8958, 
Wwww.hertz.com) is good for one-way 
rentals, letting you drop the car off for free at 
any of their Amman ofﬁces, the airport, the 
Dead Sea, Petra or Aqaba. Avis (T06 569 
9420,
Wwww.avis.com.jo) and Europcar
(T06 565 5581, Wwww.europcar.jo) - both 
with ofﬁces in Amman, the airport, the King 
Hussein/Allenby Bridge and Aqaba - are 
similar. A listing of other ﬁrms is at Wwww
.visitjordan.com.
A few agencies rent out four-wheel-drive
vehicles (called "four-by-fours") from about 
JD50 a day upwards. These are essential for 
getting to out-of-the-way archeological sites 
and touring the desert, but you need famili-
arity with 4x4 driving - and a local guide with 
you - before you head off-road. For all but 
the most dedicated adventurers, a normal 
car is ﬁne. It's a good idea to keep a few 
litres of bottled water in the car, in case you 
get stranded in some remote spot.
If you're in an accident, to claim costs 
back from the insurance company you'll 
need a full written report from the police, and 
from the ﬁrst doctor on the scene who 
treated any injuries.
Fuel
Almost all petrol stations have attendants to 
do the pumping for you: either hand over, 
say, JD10 or JD20 before he starts, or just 
ask for "full". All petrol sold in Jordan is 
unleaded - standard 90 octane (tisaeen) or 
pricier 95 octane (khamsa wa-tisaeen).
Diesel (deezel) is available rarely. Most 
stations accept cash only.
Accidents
Despite 
the 
Jordanian 
driving 
style, 
accidents are infrequent, and rarely amount 
to more than a prang. However, under 
Jordanian law any accident involving a car 
and a pedestrian is automatically deemed 
to be the fault of the driver: if you hit 
anybody, cause any sort of injury, or even if 
someone falls out of a window onto your 
stationary vehicle, you will be held respon-
sible. Goats, sheep, donkeys and camels 
roam more or less freely beside roads, but if 
you hit an animal, you will have to pay the 
owner compensation. With a goat costing, 
say, 100JD, and a camel ten times as much, 
you'd do well to keep your eyes peeled.
If you're in any sort of accident while 
behind the wheel of a rental car, call the 
rental company ﬁrst, since - if they're trust-
worthy - they will call the police on your 
behalf and then send someone out to pick 
you up. Otherwise, call the police yourself 
on T191.
Taxis and chauffeur-
driven cars
Apart from a ﬂeet of silver radio-cabs in 
Amman which can be hired by phone - at 
a premium - all taxis are yellow with green 
panels in Arabic on both front doors, and 
they'll go anywhere if the price is right. 
Inexpensive and quite often essential within 
Amman, their good value declines the 
further aﬁeld you want to go; renting a taxi 
to cover the transport-thin eastern desert, 
for instance, will cost you almost twice as 
much as if you drove there yourself in a 
rental car (but, obviously, with less of the 
stress). As far as fares go, other than within 
Amman city limits, where taxis are metered, 
you'll have to negotiate with the driver before 
setting off. Ballpark ﬁgures for particular 
routes are given in the guide, but where 
you're inventing your own itinerary, you'd 
do well to ask the advice of a disinterested 
party (such as a hotel receptionist) before-
hand. Jordanian women would never get in 
the front seat next to a male driver (there are 
very few female taxi-drivers), and, wherever

41
possible, foreign women should follow suit 
and sit in the back.
Most rent-a-car agencies can provide a 
driver for the day for about JD25 on top of 
the price of the rental; on a longer trip, JD45 
a day should cover his food and accommo-
dation costs.
Trains
At the time of writing, no scheduled 
passenger trains were operating in Jordan. 
The historic, narrow-gauge Hejaz Railway 
(see p.110), running from the Syrian border 
to Amman and south into the desert, was 
hosting only freight trains and occasional 
specials chartered by foreign tour operators 
and steam enthusiasts. A proposal to launch 
tourist services on the line from Aqaba to 
Wadi Rum - otherwise reserved for trains 
carrying phosphates to port from desert 
mines - has so far come to nothing.
Planes
Royal Jordanian (T06 510 0000, Wwww
.rj.com) operates the only domestic air route, 
between Amman (Queen Alia) and Aqaba. 
Flights run once or twice daily and take a little 
over half an hour. At JD48 one-way, this isn't 
prohibitively expensive, and means you can 
travel from city centre to city centre in around 
ninety minutes (including check-in and 
ground transfers), compared with more than 
four hours overland. In addition, the airborne 
views over the desert, the Dead Sea and the 
Petra mountains are exceptional; sit on the 
right-hand side heading south.
Bicycles
Cycling around the country is a very 
pleasant way to travel, although barely a 
handful of locals cycle (mostly in the ﬂat 
Jordan Valley) and you're likely to be 
regarded as mad if you try. Apart from the 
heat and steep hills, the only dangers are 
oblivious drivers and - very occasionally - 
groups of stone-throwing kids in remote 
villages. Although it may seem counter-intui-
tive you should try to dress conservatively if 
you're planning a solo ride in the hinterlands: 
rural villagers simply aren't used to lurid skin-
tight Lycra.
There are no bike rental ﬁrms in Jordan. 
Check Wwww.cycling-jordan.com for details 
of like-minded locals, weekend bike trips 
and spare-parts outlets. The adventure tour 
operator Terhaal (Wwww.terhaal.com) runs 
regular mountain-bike excursions around 
Madaba, Mukawir and the Dead Sea.
Accommodation
Accommodation in Jordan runs the gamut from the cheapest ﬂeapit dives all the 
way up to international-standard luxury ﬁve-star hotels. Amman, Petra and Aqaba 
have a wide choice covering all price brackets and Jordan's Dead Sea hotels are 
known as some of the best spa resort complexes in the world.
The Jordan Hotels Association (Wwww
.johotels.org) grades all hotels from one to ﬁve 
stars, with "unclassiﬁed" hotels off the bottom 
end of the scale. Bear in mind, though, that 
their system isn't wholly reliable: in this book 
we review a prominent two-star establishment 
that, in Europe, would be judged three-star, 
while at least one of Amman's ﬁve-star hotels 
in truth merits only four.
Room rates vary according to the season. 
The high season for tourism from non-Arab 
countries is spring (March-May) and autumn 
(Sept-Nov). This is when hotels are at their 
busiest, and when it is essential to book
An explanation of Jordan's money is 
on p.69.
BASICS | Accommodation

42
well in advance. In April and October, 
especially, it can be difﬁcult to ﬁnd a room at 
any budget in Petra and Aqaba. Summer 
(June-Aug) is when Arab tourism from the 
Gulf states is at its peak, but these visitors 
tend to prefer to stay in self-catering 
apartment suites, so some hotel bargains 
can be had. Hotels in Aqaba stay busy all 
winter long (Oct-April), when the luxury 
hotels on the Dead Sea are also often 
completely full - block-booked either by 
conference delegates or by tour groups, or 
packed with wealthy Ammanis on weekend 
breaks.
All hotels above 3 in our price-coding 
system tack eight percent government 
sales tax onto their quoted prices and 
generally accept payment by credit card; 
some also add another ten percent service
charge. These two surcharges are often 
indicated by "++" (or "plus-plus"). Wherever 
you go you'll ﬁnd healthy competition. Out of 
high season, a little gentle bargaining can 
often bring a discounted rate.
Standards vary widely within each price 
bracket and sometimes within each hotel: if 
the room you're shown isn't good enough, 
ask to see others. Things to look out for are 
air conditioning (or at the very least a ceiling 
fan) in summer and heating in winter; both 
are essential almost everywhere. South- or 
west-facing 
rooms 
that 
receive 
direct 
sunshine are liable to become ovens on 
summer afternoons and so stay uncomfort-
ably hot during the night; you'd do well in 
Aqaba to reject a sea view in favour of a 
cooler, north-facing balcony. Cheaper hotels 
may not have 24-hour hot water: ask in 
advance at what times hot water is available.
On a backpacker budget, there's a 
network of traveller-style hotels in all the 
major towns, and you'll easily get onto the 
grapevine for bargain excursions. In the mid-
range, you can take advantage of some 
excellent-value small hotels - almost all 
family-run - dotted on and off the beaten 
track, as well as comfortable lodges and 
cabins within several of Jordan's nature 
reserves. At the top end, Jordan's ﬁnest 
hotels can compete on equal terms with the 
best in the world.
Budget hotels
Jordan's cheapest hotels - to be found in 
all town centres - aren't hotels at all. They're 
essentially dosshouses, catering to guest 
labourers and/or long-distance truckers. 
Universally ﬁlthy, they're best avoided by 
even the most frugal travellers: washing facil-
ities are likely to be spartan or nonexistent, 
and there might be only one squat toilet to 
share.
Slightly up from these - though still well 
inside the 1 bracket - are budget hotels 
aimed either exclusively at Western tourists, 
or at both locals and tourists; often the latter 
will have some means of separation, like 
reserving one whole ﬂoor for locals only and 
another for tourists only. You'll often ﬁnd a 
choice of shared or private rooms, housing 
two, three or four beds, perhaps with some 
en-suite rooms as well. It's perfectly accept-
able to check things out before agreeing to 
pay: see if the sheets are clean (it's common 
practice in these places to leave the sheets 
at least two weeks between changes; insist 
on clean bedding before taking the room), 
the bed is stable, the ﬂyscreens on the 
Hotel price codes
Throughout this book, hotels have been categorized according to the price codes
given below, which indicate the normal price for the least expensive double room
in an establishment during the high season (excluding the 8 percent tax and 10
percent service charge levied in all hotels priced 3 and above). Single rooms can 
cost anything between seventy and a hundred percent of the double-room rates. 
Where a hotel also offers beds in shared rooms, a price per person to share has 
been given.

windows are intact, the ceiling fan works, 
the water in the bathroom is hot (or at least 
lukewarm), the toilets don't smell too much, 
and so on. It's a good rule to keep your 
passport with you at all times: with the risk 
of pickpocketing at virtually zero, the hotel 
"safe" (often just an unlocked drawer) is 
rarely safer than your own pocket.
Women travelling alone or together on a 
rock-bottom budget will have to play things 
by ear. In general - although not always - 
hotels with price code 1 that are geared 
towards Western backpackers will be safe 
and welcoming for women, whereas those 
that are mainly geared up for locals should be 
avoided. Paying slightly more to stay in hotels 
with better security and privacy is wise.
Breakfast is never included in hotels in 
the 1 price range, and - counting as an 
optional extra - provides some scope for 
bargaining in hotels priced 2 and above.
Mid-range hotels
Mid-range hotels - in the 4, 5 and 6
brackets - are all often decent, family-run 
establishments that take a pride in offering 
good service. Other than at Petra, they're 
just as likely to be targeting visiting Arab 
families as foreign tourists and thus can't 
afford to get a reputation for slovenliness. 
Lobbies are often done up in grandiose 
style, featuring gilt, fake marble and lots of 
glitter: don't be too dazzled, though, since a 
fancy lobby can sometimes prelude distinctly 
drab or gloomy rooms.
If you're after colonial character, you'll be 
disappointed: being a bedouin backwater, 
Jordan missed out on the grand age of 
hotel-building - and Amman's venerable 
Philadelphia Hotel, built soon after the 1921 
foundation of the emirate, was rather short-
sightedly bulldozed in the 1980s. Instead, 
look for character in the modest but 
comfortable lodges and cabins within 
several of Jordan's nature reserves, notably 
Dana, Ajloun and Azraq.
Luxury hotels
The luxury end of the market can offer 
remarkable value for money. An over-
concentration of hotels priced 7, 8
and 9 means that, with prudent advance 
booking (which can bring you bed and 
breakfast for less than the room-only 
walk-up rate), you could bring the cost of 
a ﬁve-star splurge down to a half or even 
a third of what you might pay in Europe 
for equivalent facilities. There are very 
few independently owned luxury hotels 
left in Jordan: almost all belong to one 
or other of the big global hotel groups - 
InterContinental (which includes Crowne 
Plaza 
and 
Holiday 
Inn), 
Mövenpick, 
Marriott, Kempinski and the like. All 
ﬁve-star hotels can cater for non-smoking
guests 
on 
request, 
generally 
with 
non-smoking ﬂoors.
Camping
Jordan has barely any facilities for camping.
Just a handful of independently run sites 
exist, often in beautiful locations but with a 
minimum of amenities. Some hotels, notably 
at Petra, allow you to camp in their grounds. 
Several of the RSCN's nature reserves have 
excellent campsites, including Dana and 
Ajloun, but you have to pay for the tents that 
are provided: pitching your own tent is 
prohibited.
At Wadi Rum, all the local desert guides 
(and most of the outside companies that 
take tourists to Rum) have campsites for 
their own customers, comprising traditional 
bedouin black goat-hair tents pitched in 
some beauty spot, often with a decent toilet 
block, kitchen and even makeshift showers: 
all bedding and amenities are supplied. If 
you prefer to visit (and camp) alone, a tent is 
not normally necessary outside the winter 
months, but Rum can be chilly at night year-
round, and tents do keep away scorpions - 
as well as the winter and spring rains. It's 
always preferable, of course, to sleep under 
the stars.
Elsewhere you should be judicious: the 
authorities disapprove of rough camping on 
the grounds of safety - though if you camp 
far away from habitation and tourist hot 
spots, no one will bother you. Always avoid 
lighting ﬁres: wood is a very scarce 
commodity. Ideally, use a multi-fuel stove or 
camping gas.

Unless you stick to a diet of familiar "interna-
tional" cuisine and take every meal in 
upmarket hotels or restaurants, you're likely 
to be eating with your ﬁngers at least some 
of the time - especially if you sample Arab 
styles of cooking, whether at low-budget 
hummus parlours or gourmet Lebanese 
restaurants. In budget diners, the only 
cutlery on the table will be a spoon, used to 
eat rice and soupy stews. More upmarket 
restaurants will provide cutlery, but even 
here, ﬂaps or pockets of ﬂat bread (similar to 
the pitta bread seen in the West) count as 
knife, fork and spoon - torn into pieces for 
scooping up dips, mopping up sauces, 
tearing meat off the bone and constructing 
personal one-bite sandwiches. Since the left
hand is traditionally used for toilet purposes, 
Jordanians instinctively always eat only with 
the right. In restaurant situations no one will 
be mortally offended if you use your left hand 
for a tricky shovelling or tearing manoeuvre, 
but using your left hand while eating from a 
communal platter in someone's house would 
be considered unhygienic; see p.58 for more 
on this kind of etiquette.
Nowhere in the country can you avoid 
cigarette smoke, least of all in cafés and 
restaurants.
When to eat
Most people have breakfast relatively early, 
before 8am. Lunch is eaten between 1 and 
3pm, and many people take a break around 
6pm for coffee and sweet pastries. The main 
meal of the day is eaten late, rarely before 
8pm; in Amman and Aqaba, restaurants may 
not start to ﬁll up until 9.30 or 10pm. 
However, in keeping with the bedouin 
tradition of relying on home cooking, you'll 
ﬁnd that even quite large towns in the 
bedouin heartland of southern Jordan, such 
as Madaba or Karak, have a bare handful of 
small, plain restaurants that do a roaring 
trade in early-evening takeaways and close 
up by 9pm.
Breakfast
The traditional Jordanian breakfast is a bowl 
of hot fuul (boiled fava beans mashed with 
lemon juice, olive oil and chopped chillis), 
always served with a long-handled ladle from 
a distinctive bulbous cooking jar and 
mopped up with fresh-baked khubez (ﬂat 
bread) - guaranteed to keep you going for 
hours.
Hummus, a cold dip of boiled 
chickpeas blended with lemon juice, garlic, 
sesame and olive oil, is lighter. Both fuul and 
hummus can be ordered to takeaway (barra)
in plastic pots. Bakeries that have an open 
oven (ﬁrin) offer a selection of savoury 
pastries, including khubez bayd (a kind of 
small egg pizza) and bite-sized pastry 
triangles (ftayer) ﬁlled with cheese (jibneh),
spinach (sabanekh), potato (batata) or meat 
(lahmeh). Larger bakeries also have chunky 
breadsticks, 
sesame-seed 
bread 
rings 
(kaak), thick slabs of crunchy toast (garshella)
and rough brown bread (khubez baladi).
Along with some olives (zaytoon) and yoghurt 
- either runny (laban) or creamy (labneh) - it's 
easy to put together a picnic breakfast.
Prices are nominal. A bowl of fuul or 
hummus costs around JD0.70; small baked 
nibbles JD0.20-0.40. Bread is sold by 
weight, with a kilo of large khubez (about ﬁve 
pieces) or small khubez (about eleven pieces) 
roughly JD0.50.
Food and drink
Bedouin tradition values home cooking over eating out. As a consequence, most 
of Jordan's restaurants are simple places serving straightforward fare. Excellent 
restaurants do exist, but must be sought out. Unadventurous travellers can easily 
ﬁnd themselves stuck in a rut of low-quality falafel and kebabs, departing the 
country never having tasted the best of what's on offer.
For a list of useful culinary terms in 
Arabic, see p.412.
BASICS | Food and drink

45
Hotel breakfasts vary wildly. At budget 
establishments, expect pretty poor fare (thin 
bread, 
margarine, 
processed 
cheese, 
marmalade, and so on). Larger hotels, 
though, 
pride 
themselves 
on 
offering 
absurdly lavish breakfast buffets, encom-
passing hummus and other dips, dozens of 
choices of fresh fruit, fresh-baked bread of 
all kinds, pancakes with syrup, an omelette 
chef on hand and a variety of cooked options 
from hash browns, baked beans and fried 
mushrooms to "beef bacon" (a substitute for 
real bacon, which, being forbidden under 
Islam, is not available at most hotel buffets). 
Some offer Japanese specialities such as 
miso soup and sushi.
Street snacks
The staple street snack in the Middle East 
is falafel, small balls of a spiced chickpea 
paste deep-fried and served stuffed into 
khubez along with some salad, a blob of 
tahini (sesame-seed paste) and optional hot 
sauce (harr). Up and down the country you'll 
also ﬁnd shawerma stands, with a huge 
vertical spit outside to tempt in customers. 
Shawerma meat is almost always lamb (only 
occasionally chicken), slabs of it compressed 
into a distinctive inverted cone shape and 
topped with chunks of fat and tomatoes to 
percolate juices down through the meat as it 
cooks - similar to a Turkish-style doner 
kebab. When you order a shawerma, the 
cook will dip a khubez into the fat under-
neath the spit and hold it against the ﬂame 
until it crackles, then ﬁll it with thin shavings 
of the meat and a little salad and hot sauce.
Depending on size, a falafel sandwich 
costs about JD0.50, a shawerma sandwich 
about JD1.
Restaurant meals
The cheapest budget diners will generally 
only have one or two main dishes on view - 
roast chicken or fuul or stew with rice - but 
you can almost always get hummus and 
salad to ﬁll out the meal. In better-quality 
Arabic restaurants, the usual way to eat is 
to order a variety of small starters (mezze),
followed by either a selection of main 
courses to be shared by everyone, or a 
single, large dish for sharing.
Good Arabic restaurants might have thirty 
different choices of mezze, from simple 
bowls of hummus or labneh up to more 
elaborate mini-mains of fried chicken liver 
(kibdet djaj) or wings (jawaneh). Universal 
favourites are tabbouleh (parsley salad), 
fattoush (salad garnished with squares of 
crunchy fried bread), warag aynab (vine 
leaves stuffed with rice, minced vegetables, 
and often meat as well) and spiced olives. 
Kibbeh - the national dish of Syria and 
Lebanon and widely available at better 
Jordanian restaurants - is a mixture of 
cracked wheat, grated onion and minced 
lamb pounded to a paste; it's usually shaped 
into oval torpedoes and deep-fried, though 
occasionally you can ﬁnd it raw (kibbeh
nayeh), a highly prized delicacy. Portions are 
small enough that two people could share 
ﬁve or six mezze as a sizeable starter or, 
depending on your appetite, a complete 
meal. Bread and a few pickles are always 
free.
Mezze are the best dishes for vegetarians
to concentrate on, with enough grains, 
pulses and vegetables to make substantial 
and interesting meat-free meals that cost 
considerably less than standard meaty 
dishes. Filling dishes such as mujeddrah
(lentils with rice and onions) and mahshi
(cooked vegetables stuffed with rice) also ﬁt 
the bill.
Main courses are almost entirely meat-
based. Any inexpensive diner can do half a 
chicken (nuss farooj) with rice and salad. 
Kebabs are also ubiquitous (the chicken 
version is called shish tawook). Lots of 
places also do lunchtime meaty stews with 
rice; the most common is with beans 
(fasooliyeh), although others feature potatoes 
or a spinach-like green called mulukhayyeh.
Jordan's national speciality is the traditional 
bedouin feast-dish of mensaf - chunks of

boiled lamb or mutton served on a bed of 
fatty rice, with pine nuts sprinkled on top and 
a tart, yoghurt-based sauce on the side to 
pour over. You'll also ﬁnd some delicious 
Palestinian 
dishes, 
including 
musakhan
(chicken steamed with onions and a sour-
ﬂavoured red berry called sumac) and 
magloobeh (essentially chicken with rice). A 
few places, mainly in Amman and the north, 
do a high-quality Syrian fatteh (meat or 
chicken cooked in an earthenware pot 
together with bread, rice, pine nuts, yoghurt, 
herbs and hummus, with myriad variations). 
Good ﬁsh (samak) is rare in Jordan; 
Amman and Aqaba's ﬁsh restaurants can't 
match the succulent St Peter's ﬁsh served 
fresh at the Resthouse in Pella. Pork is 
forbidden under Islam and only appears at 
expensive Asian restaurants.
Simple meals of chicken, stew or kebabs 
won't cost more than about JD4 for a 
stomach-ﬁlling, if not a gourmet, experience. 
Plenty of Arabic and foreign restaurants dish 
up varied, high-quality meals for JD8-10. It's 
possible to dine sumptuously on mezze at 
even the most expensive Arabic restaurants 
in the country for less than JD15 or JD20 
per head, although meaty main courses and 
wine at these places can rapidly torpedo a 
bill into the JD40s per head without too 
much effort.
Sweets
A Western-bred, naughty-but-nice guilt-
ridden attitude to confectionery can only 
quail in the face of the unabashedly sugar-
happy, no-holds-barred Levantine sweet 
tooth: most Arabic sweets (halawiyyat) are 
packed with enough sugar, syrup, butter and 
honey to give a nutritionist the screaming 
horrors.
The traditional Jordanian way to round off 
a meal is with fresh fruit. Restaurants may 
offer a small choice of desserts, including 
some of the items described below, but 
inexpensive eateries frequently have nothing 
sweet. However, all large towns have plenty 
of patisseries for halawiyyat: it's common to 
take a quarter- or half-kilo away in a box to 
munch at a nearby coffee house.
There are three broad categories of halawi-
yyat: large round trays of hot, fresh-made 
confections, often grain-based, which are 
sliced into squares and drenched in hot 
syrup; piles of pre-prepared, bite-sized 
honey-dripping pastries and cakes; and 
stacks of dry sesame-seed or date-ﬁlled 
biscuits. The best of the hot sweets made 
in trays is k'naffy (or kunafeh or kanafa), a 
heavenly Palestinian speciality of buttery 
shredded ﬁlo pastry layered over melted 
goat's cheese. Baglawa - layered ﬂaky 
pastry ﬁlled with pistachios or other nuts - is 
available in any number of different varieties. 
Juice-stands often lay out tempting trays of 
hareeseh, a syrupy semolina almond-cake, 
sliced into individual portions. Of the biscuits, 
you'd have to go a long way to beat 
maamoul, buttery, crumbly rose-scented 
things with a date or nut ﬁlling. Everything is 
sold by weight, and you can pick and 
choose a mixture: a quarter-kilo (wagiyyeh) - 
rarely more than JD2 - is plenty for two.
Large restaurants and some patisseries 
also 
have 
milk-based 
sweets, 
often 
ﬂavoured deliciously with rosewater. King of 
these is muhallabiyyeh, a semi-set almond 
cream pudding served in individual bowls, 
but the Egyptian speciality Umm Ali - not 
dissimilar to bread pudding, served hot, 
sprinkled with nuts and cinnamon - runs a 
close second.
Curiously elastic, super-sweet ice cream
(boozeh) is a summer standard. During 
Ramadan bakeries and patisseries make 
fresh gatayyif - traditional pancakes - often 
on hotplates set up on the street. Locals buy 
stacks of them for stufﬁng at home with nuts 
and syrup.
Fresh fruit and picnic 
food
Street markets groan with fresh fruit,
including apples from Shobak and oranges, 
mandarins and bananas from Gaza and the 
Jordan Valley. Local bananas (or the 
common Somali ones) are smaller, blacker 
and sweeter than the bland, oversized 
clones imported from Latin America. In the 
late spring, Fuheis produces boxes of 
luscious peaches; local grapes come from 
the Balqa and Palestine. Exquisite dates, 
chieﬂy Iraqi, Saudi and Omani, are available 
packed year-round and also fresh in late 
autumn, when you'll also see stalls selling 
small, yellow-orange fruit often still on the 
BASICS | Food and drink

47
branch; these are balah, sweet, crunchy 
unripe dates that seldom make it to the 
West. Look out for pomegranates around 
the same time, while spring and summer are 
the season for local melon and watermelon.
For picnic supplements, most towns have 
a good range of stalls or mobile vendors 
selling dried fruit and roasted nuts and 
seeds. Raisins, sultanas, dried ﬁgs and dried 
apricots can all be found cheaply every-
where. The most popular kind of seeds are 
bizr (dry-roasted melon, watermelon or 
sunﬂower seeds), the cracking of which in 
order to get at the minuscule kernel is an 
acquired skill. Local almonds (luz) are delec-
table. Pistachios and roasted chickpeas are 
locally produced; peanuts, hazelnuts and 
cashews are imported. It's often possible to 
buy individual hard-boiled eggs from neigh-
bourhood groceries, and varieties of the local 
salty white cheese (jibneh) are available 
everywhere.
Tea, coffee and other 
drinks
The main focus of every Jordanian village, 
town and city neighbourhood is a coffee 
house, 
where 
friends 
and 
neighbours 
meet, gossip does the rounds and a quiet 
moment can be had away from the family. 
The musicians, poets and storytellers of 
previous generations have been replaced 
everywhere by TV music or sport, although 
a 
genial, 
sociable 
ambience 
survives. 
However, traditional coffee houses (unlike 
the Starbucks-style espresso bars which 
predominate in West Amman and elsewhere) 
are exclusively male domains and bastions 
of social tradition; foreign women will always 
be served without hesitation, but sometimes 
might feel uncomfortably watched.
The national drink, lubricating every social 
occasion, is tea (shy), a strong, dark brew 
served scalding-hot and milkless in small

religious and civil law from smoking and from eating or drinking anything - 
including water and, in the strictest interpretations, even their own saliva - during 
the hours of daylight. Throughout Ramadan, almost all cafés and restaurants 
nationwide (apart from those in big hotels) stay closed until sunset, whereupon most

or three light dinners as the evening goes on, moving from one group of friends or 
relatives to the next.
For foreigners, nothing serious will happen if you inadvertently light up a cigarette 
in public during the day, but the locals will not thank you for walking down the street 
munching a sandwich: if you do, expect lots of shouting and perhaps some 
unpleasantness. All four- and ﬁve-star hotels serve both food and soft drinks to 
foreigners during daylight, although they will only do so in places out of view of the 
street. If you're travelling on a tight budget and are buying picnic food for both 
breakfast and lunch, you'll need to exercise a good deal of tact during the day in 
eating either behind closed doors or well out of sight in the countryside.
It is illegal for supermarkets and the majority of restaurants (that is, all those 
below a certain star rating) to sell alcohol for the entire month. At the time of 
writing, it was possible for non-Jordanians to buy and consume alcohol during 
Ramadan in ﬁve-star hotels and a handful of independent restaurants (mostly in 
Amman), but you may ﬁnd the rules have changed when you visit.

glasses. The traditional method of tea-
making is to boil up loose leaves in a pot 
together with several spoons of sugar to 
allow maximum ﬂavour infusion. In deference 
to foreign taste buds, you may ﬁnd the sugar 
being left to your discretion, but the tannins 
in steeped tea are so lip-curlingly bitter that 
you'll probably prefer the Jordanian way.
Coffee (gahweh), another national institu-
tion, has two broad varieties. Turkish 
coffee is what you'll come across most 
often. Made by boiling up cardamom-
ﬂavoured grounds in a distinctive long-
handled pot, then letting it cool, then 
reboiling it several times (traditionally seven, 
though in practice two sufﬁces), it's served 
in small cups along with a glass of water as 
chaser. Sugar is added beforehand, so you 
should request your coffee unsweetened 
(saada), medium-sweet (wasat) or syrupy 
(helweh). Let the grounds settle before 
sipping, and leave the last mouthful, which 
is mud, behind. Arabic coffee, also known 
as bedouin coffee, is an entirely different, 
almost greenish liquid, unsweetened and 
pleasantly bitter, traditionally made in a 
long-spouted brass pot set in hot embers. 
Public coffee houses don't have it, and 
you'll only be served it - often, rather 
prosaically, from a thermos ﬂask - in a 
social situation by bedouin themselves (for 
example, if you're meeting with a police 
ofﬁcer or government ofﬁcial, or if you're 
invited to a family tent in Wadi Rum).
Coffee houses also serve soft drinks and a 
wide range of seasonal herbal teas,
including mint, fennel, fenugreek, thyme, 
sage and camomile. In colder seasons at 
coffee houses and street-stands, you'll come 
across the winter-warmer sahleb, a thick 
milky drink made from a ground-up orchid 
tuber and served very hot sprinkled with 
nuts, cinnamon and coconut.
A coffee house is also the place to try a 
tobacco-ﬁlled water pipe, known by different 
names around the Arab world but most 
familiarly in Jordan as a "hubbly-bubbly" or 
argileh. Many upscale restaurants offer an 
argileh as a postprandial digestive. It is 
utterly unlike smoking a cigarette: the 
tobacco is nearly always ﬂavoured sweetly 
with apple or honey, and this, coupled with 
the smoke cooling as it bubbles through the 
water chamber before you inhale, makes the 
whole experience pleasant and soothing.
Water
Although Jordanians drink water freely from 
the tap, you might prefer not to: it is chlorin-
ated strongly enough not to do you any harm 
(it just tastes bad), but the pipes it runs 
through add a quantity of rust and ﬁlth you 
could do without. All hotels above three stars 
have water ﬁltration systems in place, which 
help. Bottles of mineral water, both local 
and imported, are available inexpensively in 
all corners of the country. A standard 1.5-litre 
size costs roughly JD0.35 if you buy it 
individually, less if you buy a six-pack from a 
supermarket or grocery. Expect to pay more 
in out-of-the-way places - JD1 or more 
inside Petra. Check that the seal is unbroken 
before you buy. Inexpensive diners always 
have jugs of tap water (my aadi) on the table, 
but in restaurants waiters will quite often 
bring an overpriced bottle of mineral water to 
your table with the menu - which you're 
quite entitled to reject. Recycling facilities for 
plastics are few and far between. If you can, 
crush the bottles that you buy and take them 
out of the country with you when you leave.
Fresh juice and squash
Most Jordanian towns have at least one 
stand-up juice-bar; these are great places 
for supplementing a meagre breakfast or 
replenishing your vitamin C. Any fruit in view 
can be juiced or puréed. Sugar (sukkr) and 
ice (talj) are automatically added to almost 
everything; however, considering ice blocks 
are often wheeled in ﬁlthy trolleys along the 
roadside and broken up with a screwdriver, 
you might like to give it a miss - if so, request 
your juice bidoon talj ("without sugar" is 
bidoon sukkr). Most freshly squeezed juices, 
and mixed juice cocktails, cost JD0.35-0.40 
for a "small" glass (actually quite big), double 
that for a pint. Mango, strawberry and other 
exotic fruit cost a little more.
More popular, and thus easier to ﬁnd, are 
much cheaper ready-made fruit squashes.
Dark-brown 
tamarhindi 
(tamarind, 
tartly 
refreshing) and kharroub (carob, sweet-but-
sour), or watery limoon (lemon squash) are 
the best bets; other, less common, choices 
BASICS | Food and drink

49
include soos (made from liquorice root, also 
dark brown and horribly bitter) and luz (sickly 
sweet white almond-milk). All are around 
JD0.10 a glass.
Alcohol
Drinking alcohol is forbidden under Islam. 
That said, Jordan is not Saudi Arabia, and 
alcohol is widely available - but you have to 
look for it: the market streets and ordinary 
eateries of most towns show no evidence of 
the stuff at all.
Apart from in big hotels, the only restau-
rants to offer alcohol are upscale independ-
ently owned establishments and tourist 
resthouses at some archeological sites. 
Most big supermarkets and some smaller 
convenience stores sell alcohol. Amman has 
a lot of bars, not all of them inside hotels. 
Places such as Aqaba and Petra that serve 
tourists (or Madaba, with a prominent 
Christian population) also have some bars. 
Expect to ﬁnd little or no alcohol elsewhere.
Drinking alcohol in public, or showing 
signs of drunkenness in public - which 
includes on the street, in cafés or coffee 
houses, in most hotel lobbies, on the beach 
or even in the seemingly empty desert or 
countryside - is utterly taboo and will cause 
great offence to local people.
The predominant local beer is Amstel, 
brewed under licence and very palatable. It's 
available in cans and bottles, and also on 
draught in some bars: a large glass costs 
around JD5.
There's a good range of Jordanian wines.
The "Grands Vins de Jordanie" brand of 
Zumot (Wwww.zumotgroup.com) includes 
fruity Cabernet and Merlot (labelled St George) 
and 
fresh, 
very 
drinkable 
Chardonnay/
Sauvignon 
Blanc 
(labelled 
Machaerus). 
Haddad, trading as Eagle (Wwww.eagledis
.com), are best known for their bright Mount 
Nebo whites, alongside the Jordan River 
range which includes a Cabernet Sauvignon, 
a rich, plummy Shiraz and a light, spicy 
Chardonnay. These - along with widely 
available Palestinian "Holy Land" wines - are 
around JD6-10 a bottle, much less than 
imported wines. The top local spirit is anise-
ﬂavoured araq (similar to Turkish raki), drunk 
during a meal over ice, diluted with water. A 
bottle of premium araq - whether from Zumot, 
Eagle or more prestigious Lebanese distilleries 
- will set you back JD15 or so.
The media
With the widespread use of English in public life, you'll have relatively good 
access to news while in Jordan. International newspapers and magazines are on 
sale, the local English-language press is burgeoning and satellite TV is widespread.
Arabic press
Among the region's conservative and often 
state-owned
Arabic 
press, 
Jordan's 
newspapers, all of which are independently 
owned, have a reputation for relatively well-
informed debate, although strict press laws 
- and the slow process of media liberaliza-
tion - cause much controversy. The two 
biggest dailies, ad-Dustour ("Constitution") 
and al-Ra'i ("Opinion"), are both centrist 
regurgitators 
of 
government 
opinion; 
al-Ghad ("Tomorrow") has a fresher outlook. 
There's a host of other dailies and weeklies, 
ranging from the sober to the sensational.
English-language press
International 
newspapers 
are 
widely 
available from the news kiosks in all big 
hotels and also from some bookshops. The

dailies and Sundays are generally one or two 
days late (JD2 and upwards). Look out for 
excellent regional papers such as The
National (Wwww.thenational.ae), published 
daily in Abu Dhabi and available same day in 
Amman, and Cairo's Al-Ahram Weekly
(Wweekly.ahram.org.eg).
For local newspapers in English, the 
Jordan Times (Wwww.jordantimes.com) is 
published daily except Saturdays, featuring 
national news, agency reports and pro-
government comment, as well as useful 
what's-on information. The weekly Star
(Wwww.star.com.jo) tends to be more 
independent-minded, but it's a thin read.
There's a lively market for Jordanian 
magazines, with a range of English-language 
monthlies including glossy Living Well (Wwww
.livingwell-magazine.com), upmarket lads' mag 
Nox (Wwww.nox-mag.com) and sober Jordan 
Business (Wwww.jordan-business.net). Plenty 
of international magazines are available, from 
Cosmopolitan to The Economist.
TV and radio
Jordanian TV (Wwww.jrtv.jo) isn't up to 
much. Almost all hotels have satellite TV,
featuring CNN, BBC World News, Al Jazeera 
English, plus a few movies and sitcoms in 
English, 
alongside 
dozens 
of 
Arabic, 
European and Asian channels.
As well as stations devoted to Arabic 
pop and old-time classics, Amman has 
several 
English-language 
music 
radio
stations playing Western rock and dance. 
Radio Jordan's English station (on 96.3FM 
in Amman and 855kHz AM nationwide) 
- mostly chart hits - has some news 
bulletins.
BBC World Service (Wwww
.bbcworldservice.com) 
broadcasts 
on 
1323kHz AM (medium wave) but can be 
difﬁcult to pick up.
Adventure tours and trekking
Taking an organized tour once you arrive in Jordan can turn out to be the most 
rewarding way to get to some of the more isolated attractions in the hinterland.
There are hundreds of Jordanian tour 
operators dealing with incoming tourism, 
but only a handful can take you off the 
beaten track: the principal outﬁts are listed 
below. To get a good idea of the terrain, as

almost all arrive full of all kinds of ideas about the creatures; myths about the 
simplicity of desert life, the nobility of the bedouin and the Lawrence-of-Arabia-style 
romance of desert culture all seem to be inextricably bound up in Western minds 
with the camel. In truth, the bedouin long since gave up using camels either as a 
means of transport or as beasts of burden: Japanese pick-ups are faster, sturdier, 
longer-lived and less bad-tempered than your average dromedary. However, some 
tribes still keep a few camels, mostly for nostalgic reasons and the milk, though 
some breed and sell them. The bedouin that live in or close to touristed areas such 
as Petra and Rum have small herds of them to rent out for walks and desert 
excursions. There are no wild camels left in Jordan: any you see, in however remote 
a location, belong to someone.
If you're in any doubt about whether to take the plunge and have a camel ride,
then rest assured that it's a wonderful experience. There's absolutely nothing to 
compare with the gentle, hypnotic swaying and soft shufﬂe of riding camel-back in 
the open desert. The Wadi Rum area is the best place in Jordan to try it out, with 
short and long routes branching out from Rum and Diseh all over the southern 
desert. Take as long as you like, but anything less than a couple of hours' riding isn't 
really worth it.
As a beginner's tip, the key to not falling off a camel is to hang onto the pommel 
between your legs; the animal gets up from sitting with a bronco-style triple jerk 
that ﬂings you backwards, then forwards, then back again. If you're not holding on 
as soon as your bottom hits the saddle you're liable to end up in the dust. Once up 
and moving, you have a choice of riding your mount like a stirrupless horse, or 
copying the locals and cocking one leg around the pommel.

You generally have to bring your own gear (change of 
clothes or shoes, sleeping bag if on an overnight trek, 
etc) as well as food and water.
Trekking
The opportunities for getting out into 
Jordan's varied landscapes are limited only 
by your own preparation and ﬁtness. It's 
easy for anyone of moderate ability to 
embark on half- or full-day walks from most 
towns. What you can't expect is any kind of 
trail support: no signposts, no refreshment 
facilities and often no trail markers; there are 
also virtually no maps useful for walkers 
available. In recompense, you'll generally be 
walking alone in pristine countryside. For 
greater insight, and a full range of detailed 
route descriptions, your best bet is to get 
hold of almost the only book on the subject 
- Jordan: Walks, Treks, Caves, Climbs and 
Canyons by Di Taylor and Tony Howard 
(2008 edition; see p.404).
Trekking in Jordan is in its infancy, other 
than in the unique mountains and deserts 
of Wadi Rum, where it plays an important 
role in the local economy: as at Petra, 
trekking services at Rum are offered by 
local people who still proudly consider 
themselves bedouin. Plenty of the best 
routes in and around Rum - as well as 
ancient caravan trails around Petra - are 
known only to the locals.
Elsewhere, only a handful of individuals 
and the RSCN (Royal Society for the 
Conservation of Nature) understand the 
theory and practice of trekking. Through its 
"Wild Jordan" ofﬁce, the RSCN offers 
carefully controlled access to the country's 
nature reserves - environmentally fragile, 
protected landscapes that are largely off-
limits to visitors: the RSCN allows trekking 
only on designated trails with qualiﬁed 
RSCN nature guides. On no account should 
you enter the reserves without permission, 
or stray off-trail.
Outside these places, in the rugged 
mountains near Aqaba or the green hills of 
the far north, for example, there are no 
marked trails and no guides. Indeed, it is 
highly unlikely that while walking you'll come 
across anyone other than locals, some of 
whom may be happy to guide you - and all 
of whom will welcome you with the full 
warmth of Jordanian hospitality. Offers of tea 
and refreshment are likely to ﬂow thick and 
fast as you pass through rural villages.
See p.43 for guidance on camping.
Terrain
Jordan's terrain
is spectacularly varied. 
Anyone expecting a desert country will be 
astonished by the alpine-style meadows of 
north Jordan, which are carpeted in ﬂowers 
in springtime, warm breezes carrying the 
aromas of herbs and pine. The hills of Ajloun 
in April are simply captivating - a gentle 
terrain, with no real hazards other than the 
lack of water. The RSCN's forest reserves at 
Ajloun and Dibbeen offer access into the 
area.
The Dead Sea hills, also dubbed the 
"Mountains of Moab", offer a more savage 
prospect, gashed by wild canyons which 
ﬂash-ﬂood after rains. They require respectful 
treatment. Their northern reaches fall within 
the boundaries of the RSCN's Mujib reserve, 
where you can tackle the spectacular 
descent 
of 
the 
Mujib 
gorge, 
though 
independent adventure guides also offer 
access to similar exploration of neighbouring 
canyons outside the reserve such as Wadi 
Zarqa Ma'in or Wadi Mukheiris.
The southern part of the Moab hills around 
Karak, 
with 
excellent 
trekking 
and 
canyoning, is also outside the Mujib reserve. 
Hiking here, alongside water in the midst of 
harsh desert terrain, is always a pleasure. 
This part of the country is still very much off 
the beaten track, but you may be able to ﬁnd

a company or a specialist guide organizing 
trips to the beautiful and varied canyon of 
Wadi ibn Hammad.
Further south is the RSCN reserve at 
Dana, its ancient village perched like an eyrie 
above the wild Wadi Dana. This is, under-
standably, the pride of the RSCN, who 
organize some excellent treks past oases 
and ancient copper mines down to their 
wilderness lodge in Wadi Faynan, as well as 
other routes in far-ﬂung parts of these hills, 
including around their remote Rummana 
campsite.
The fabulous city of Petra is concealed 
beyond the next range of hills to the south. 
While you could spend days hiking around 
this remarkable site, most walkers will feel 
the urge to explore further. Navigating paths 
through this craggy range of mountains is, 
however, extremely complex, and water-
holes are few: until you gain conﬁdence in 
the area, you should take a local guide. 
Independent guides offer a superb four-night 
wilderness trek from Faynan (on the edge of 
the Dana reserve) all the way to Petra, and 
local companies in Wadi Musa can set up 
excellent week-long camel- or horseriding 
treks from Petra to Rum.
At Wadi Rum, don't let the multitudes of 
tour buses deter you. Out in the desert, 
away from the very few, well-travelled, one-
hour safari routes taken by day-trippers, all 
is solitude. The rock climbing in Rum is 
world-famous, but for the walker there is 
also much to offer, both dramatic canyon 
scrambles and delightful desert valleys. 
Again, be sure of your abilities if you go 
without a guide: bedouin camps are rare and 
only those intimate with Rum will ﬁnd water. 
Far better is to get to know the local bedouin 
and hire a guide: a real desert experience is 
just as much about the people as the place. 
The rigorous ascent of the mighty Jebel 
Rum by a bedouin hunting route - well 
known to qualiﬁed guides - or the relatively 
easy scramble to the summit of Jebel Umm 
ad-Daami, Jordan's highest mountain, is a 
world-class experience open to any ﬁt and 
conﬁdent person.
Clothing, equipment and preparation
You should take a minimalist approach to 
clothing and equipment. Heavy boots 
aren't necessary; good, supportive trainers 
or very lightweight boots are adequate. 
Quality socks are important and should be 
washed or changed frequently to keep the 
sand out and minimize blisters. Clothing, too, 
should be lightweight and cotton or similar: 
long trousers and long-sleeved tops will limit 
dehydration and are essential on grounds of 
modesty when passing through villages or 
visiting bedouin camps. A sunhat, proper 
protective 
sunglasses 
and 
high-factor 
sunblock are also essential, as are a light 
windproof top and ﬂeece. Basic trip prepa-
ration also includes carrying a mobile phone 
(bear in mind that coverage can be patchy, 
particularly on mountains and in canyons), a 
watch, a medical kit and a compass, and 
knowing how to use them all. You should 
carry a minimum of three litres of water per 
day for an easy walk, perhaps six or eight 
litres per day for exertive treks or multi-day 
trips. On toilet procedures, if you're caught 
short in the wilds, make sure that you squat 
far away from trails and water supplies, and 
bury the result deeply. Toilet paper is both 
unsightly and unhygienic (goats will eat

anything!); the best way to clean yourself is 
with water, but if you must use paper, either 
burn it or store it in a plastic bag and dispose 
of it correctly when you get back to a town.
Part of your preparation for trekking in 
Jordan must involve familiarizing yourself 
with the dangers of ﬂash ﬂoods, most perti-
nently if you intend walking in narrow valleys 
and canyons, even in the desert: deluges are 
life-threatening. You should carry 10m of 
rope for emergency use.
There are no ofﬁcial search and rescue 
organizations, so, however straightforward 
your hike may seem, you must always tell
someone responsible (such as a reliable 
friend or the tourist police) where you are 
going. You must then follow or stick close to 
your stated route, and check in when you 
return or reach your destination.
Hiring trekking/adventure guides
Fees for trekking guides vary throughout 
Jordan. The RSCN sets its own rates within 
each of the reserves - at the time of writing, 
for instance, in Dana a group of up to 18 
people pays JD15-20 for one hour or JD35-
40 for six hours, whereas in Mujib each 
person pays around JD10 to be guided 
along an easy trail (2-3hr) or up to JD45 for 
guiding on a full-day trek. As visitor numbers 
to the reserves are limited, you should 
always book well in advance.
In Rum, you should reckon on roughly 
JD50-60 per person for a high-quality full-
day jeep tour in a vehicle seating four to six 
people with a knowledgeable English-
speaking guide, including dinner, overnight 
desert camping with everything provided, 
and breakfast. (Cheaper deals are widely 
available - but you get what you pay for.) 
Guiding on scrambles and climbs that 
require ropes for safety costs considerably 
more, in the order of JD150-200 per day - 
and rightly so; it's a responsible job. 
Whatever you're planning, it's always best to 
book ahead.
Rates are similar in the Petra area, where 
adventure/trekking guides are only bookable 
through local tour companies. To be guided 
on a private one-day adventure trek - for 
instance through a gorge such as Wadi bin 
Hammad near Karak, Wadi Ghweir near 
Dana or one of the canyons above the Dead 
Sea - expect to pay in the order of JD80-
120 per person, less if it's on easier terrain 
(and less if you join a scheduled group trip, 
such as through one of the operators listed 
on p.50).
If you've enjoyed your trip, tipping your 
guide is entirely appropriate. Ten percent 
would be ﬁne, but you may want to give 
more - or perhaps a gift of a useful item of 
clothing 
or 
equipment. 
RSCN 
guides 
working in the reserves are not allowed to 
accept tips.
Culture and etiquette
Your experience of Jordanian people is likely to be that they are, almost without 
exception, decent, honest, respectful and friendly. It seems only right that you 
should return some of that respect by showing a grasp of some basic aspects of 
Jordanian, Arab and Muslim culture.
If it's possible to generalize, the three things 
that annoy local people most about foreign 
tourists in Jordan are immodest dress,
public displays of affection and lack of 
social respect. In this section we try to 
explain why, and how to avoid causing 
upset.
Nonetheless, as you travel through the 
country you will doubtless see dozens of 
tourists breaking these taboos (and others), 
BASICS | Culture and etiquette

55
sometimes unwittingly, sometimes deliber-
ately. Nothing bad happens to them. Jordan 
is a relatively liberal society and there are no 
Saudi-style religious police marching around 
to throw offenders in jail. Jordanians would 
never be so rude as to tell visitors to their 
country that they are being crass and insensi-
tive; instead, they'll smile and say, "Welcome 
to Jordan!" - but still, the damage has been 
done. You might prefer to be different.
Incidentally, you may also see Jordanians 
acting and dressing less conservatively than 
we recommend here. That is, of course, their 
prerogative - to shape, inﬂuence or challenge 
their own culture from within, in whatever 
ways they choose. It goes without saying 
that tourists do not share the same rights 
over Jordanian culture. The onus is on 
visitors to ﬁt in.
Dress codes
Outward appearance is the one facet of inter-
action between locals and Western tourists 
most open to misunderstandings on both 
sides. A lot of tourists, male and female, 
consistently ﬂout simple dress codes,
unaware of just how much it widens the 
cultural divide and demeans them in the eyes 
of local people. Clothes that are unremarkable 
at home can come across in Jordan as being 
embarrassing, disrespectful or offensive.
Jordanians and Palestinians place a much 
greater emphasis on personal grooming and 
style of dress than people tend to in the 
West: for them, consciously "dressing down" 
in torn or holey clothes is unthinkable. In 
addition, for reasons of modesty, many 
people expose as little skin as possible, with 
long sleeves and high necklines for both 
sexes.
Male dress codes
Visiting tourists who wear shorts on the 
street give roughly the same impression that 
they would wandering around Bournemouth 
or Baltimore in their underpants. Long 
trousers are essential in the city, the 
country and the desert, whatever the 
weather - clean and respectable light 
cotton, denim or canvas ones in plain 
colours (not ﬂimsy, brightly patterned 
beach-style trousers). If you must wear 
shorts, go for the loose-ﬁtting knee-length 
variety rather than brief, shape-hugging 
athlete's shorts. Any top that doesn't cover 
your shoulders and upper arms counts as 
underwear. Wear a T-shirt if you like, but a 
buttoned shirt broadcasts a sounder 
message about the kind of value you place 
on cultural sensitivity. Jordanian men never, 
in any situation, walk around topless.
Words of welcome
Ahlan wa sahlan is the phrase you'll hear most often in Jordan. It's most commonly 
SFOEFSFEBTiXFMDPNFwCVUUSBOTMBUFTEJSFDUMZBTiGBNJMZBOEFBTFwBOETPNJHIU

my house/shop/city/country]". With hospitality a fundamental part of Arab culture, 
there's no warmer or more open-hearted phrase in the language. Everybody uses it, 
in all situations of meeting and greeting, often repeated like a mantra in long strings.
As a visitor, you needn't ever say ahlan wa sahlan yourself, but you'll have to ﬁeld 
torrents of them from the locals. The proper response - even if you're walking past 
without stopping - is ahlan beek (beeki if you're talking to a woman). Alternatively 
you can acknowledge the welcome with a smile and shukran	iUIBOLZPVw

The catch-all word used to invite someone - whether welcoming an old friend 
into your home or inviting a stranger to share your lunch (surprisingly common) - is 
itfuddal, often said together with ahlan wa sahlan. Translations of itfuddal
(itfuddalee to a woman, itfuddaloo to more than one person) can vary, depending

the offer, is to smile and say shukran	iUIBOLZPVw

Female dress codes
To interact as a Western woman in Jordanian 
society with some degree of mutual respect, 
you'll probably have to go to even greater 
lengths than men to adjust your normal style 
of dress, although it is possible to do so 
without compromising your freedom and 
individuality 
too 
much. 
Loose-ﬁtting,
opaque clothes that cover your legs, arms 
and chest are a major help in allowing you to 
relate normally with local men. On women, 
shorts appear ﬂagrantly provocative and 
sexual, as do Lycra leggings. T-shirts are 
also best avoided. The nape of the neck is 
considered particularly erotic and so is best 
covered, either by a high collar or a thin 
cotton scarf.
Hair is another area where conservatism 
helps deter unwanted attention. Jordanian 
women who don't wear a headscarf rarely 
let long hair hang below their shoulders; you 
might like to follow suit and clip long hair up. 
To some people, women with wet hair are 
advertising sexual availability, so you may 
prefer to dry your hair before going out. If 
your hair is blonde, you must unfortunately 
resign yourself to a bit more inquisitive 
attention - at least when walking in more 
conservative areas.
Social interactions
Social interaction in Jordan is replete with 
all kinds of seemingly impenetrable verbal 
and behavioural rituals, most of which can 
remain unaddressed by foreigners with 
impunity. A few things are worth knowing, 
however.
The energy which Jordanians put into 
social relationships can bring shame to 
Westerners used to keeping a distance. Total 
strangers greet each other like chums and 
chat happily about nothing special, passers-
by ask each other's advice or exchange 
opinions without a second thought, and old 
friends embark on ﬁve-minute volleys of 
salutations and cheek-kisses, joyful arm-
squeezing or back-slapping, and earnest 
enquiries after health, family, business and 
news. Foreigners more used to avoiding 
From a woman's perspective - some sample experiences

was, by people's reactions - the best preparation is just to head out with self-
conﬁdence, curiosity and a sense of humour. People are extremely willing to help, 
and almost everyone invited me for tea - a boy selling tablecloths, taxi-drivers, even 
the guardian in the museum.
Travelling for a time with a male friend felt a little unreal. Suddenly, people stopped 
talking to me and paid attention only to him. This was probably due more to respect 
for me than condescension, but I couldn't help feeling a little upset - though it put 
me in a great position to just observe events.
It is vital to be able to take things lightly. For instance, I was followed by a bunch 
of teenage boys for at least an hour through the whole of Salt. They had a great 
UJNFSVOOJOHBSPVOEBOENBLJOHKPLFT.ZNJTUBLFXBTUPUSZBOEHFUBXBZ*

a picture. They'd have loved that."

locked, the shades were down. I happened to glance up. Above the closet there 
was a small set of windows (hadn't noticed them before), with a man's face, quickly 
disappearing.

without an ounce of shame. Being spied on is no surprise in any culture, but his lack 
of shame was a cultural lesson for me - not about relations between men and 
women in Jordan (because I think Jordanian women command a great deal of 
respect), but rather because I was assumed not to question his rights over my body.

strangers and doing business in shops 
quickly and impersonally can come across 
as cold, uninterested and even snooty. 
Smiling, learning one or two of the standard 
forms of greeting (see p.408), acknowl-
edging those who are welcoming you and 
taking the time to exchange pleasantries will 
bring you closer to people more quickly than 
anything else.
People shake hands in Jordan much more 
than in the West, and even the merest 
contact with a stranger is normally punctu-
ated by at least one or two handshakes to 
indicate fraternity.
Personal space
Personal space is treated rather differently 
in Arab cultures from in the West: for all 
intents and purposes, it doesn't exist. 
Queuing is a foreign notion, and in many 
situations hanging back deferentially is an 
invitation for other people to move in front. 
Jordanians also relate to the natural
environment 
rather 
differently 
from 
Westerners. Sitting alone or with a friend in 
the most perfectly tranquil spot, you may 
well ﬁnd someone coming up to you blocking 
the sunset and eager for a chat. It can be 
difﬁcult, if not impossible, to convey your 
desire to be alone.
Invitations
It's almost inevitable that during your time in 
Jordan you'll be invited to drink tea with 
someone, either in their shop or their home, 
and it's quite likely too that at some point 
you'll be invited for a full meal at someone's 
house. Jordanians take hospitality very much 
to heart, and are honestly interested in 
talking to you and making you feel comfort-
able. However, offers tend to ﬂow so thick 
and fast that it would be difﬁcult to agree to 
every one, yet people are often so eager it 
can also be difﬁcult - and potentially rude - 
to refuse outright.
First and foremost, whether you're inter-
ested or not, is to take the time to chat civilly; 
nothing is more offensive than walking on 
without a word or making an impatient 
gesture, even if they're the twentieth person 
You can regulate the respect you receive according to the way you dress. 
Complying with the standards of the place you're visiting relieves you from 
harassment. It also signals your intention to understand. The assumptions about 
Western women are so image-based that changing your image will change your 
reception. It's as simple as that."

dress and behaviour to match social norms helped immensely. Just wearing loose 
clothes and long-sleeved shirts made me feel more conﬁdent and relaxed, 
especially in more traditional areas, and allowed local people to take me seriously. 
Being friendly with men I didn't know inevitably got me in trouble, since they 
interpreted it as ﬂirting: I tried never to smile at men on the street and to keep my 
interactions with waiters and shopkeepers on a reserved and businesslike footing. 
This doesn't mean I didn't get stared at - I did. But I came to accept that in some 
places, as a foreigner, I was an exotic sight to be seen, as much as Jordanian 
people are exotic to visitors.
The ﬂipside of avoiding men's stares was that I could smile and look freely at 
women. Since most women adopt a serious, frozen expression on the street it was a 
great surprise, smiling tentatively at a woman passer-by or exchanging a few words 
of greeting, to see her face light up with a broad smile in response. I had an 
immediate, spontaneous connection which surpassed words and cultural 
differences."

that day to stop you. If you're invited and 
you don't want to accept, a broad smile with 
your head lowered, your right hand over your 
heart and "shukran shukran" ("thank you, 
thank you") is a clear, but socially accept-
able, no. You may have to do this several 
times - it's all part of the social ritual of polite 
insistence. Adding "marra okhra, insha'allah"
("another time, if God wills it") softens the 
"no" still further, indicating that you won't 
forget their kind offer.
The advice below applies if you have 
personally been invited to a private gathering. 
If you are attending, for example, a "bedouin 
dinner" as part of a tour-group itinerary, the 
event is commercial: you are paying for the 
experience, so the same social norms and 
values don't apply. In this situation, your 
bedouin hosts will be tourism professionals, 
probably with good English.
Before the meal
If you're invited to eat with someone at
home and you choose to accept, the ﬁrst 
thing to consider is how to repay your 
host's hospitality. Attempting to offer 
money would be deeply offensive - what is 
appropriate is to bring some token of your 
appreciation. A kilo or two of sweet pastries 
handed to your host as you arrive will be 
immediately ferreted away out of sight and 
never referred to again; the gesture, however, 
will have been appreciated. Otherwise, 
Gestures and body language
There's a whole range of gestures used in Arab culture which will either be new to 
you or which carry different meanings from the same gesture in your home country. 
Rather than nodding, yes is indicated by inclining your head forwards and closing 
your eyes. No is raising your eyebrows and tilting your head up and back, often 
BDDPNQBOJFECZBMJUUMFiUTLwOPJTF	XIJDIdoesn't indicate impatience or 
displeasure). Shaking your head from side to side means I don't understand. A very 
useful gesture, which can be used a hundred times a day in all kinds of situations, is 
putting your right hand over your heart: this indicates genuineness or sincerity, 
BOEDBOTPGUFOBiOPUIBOLTwUPBTUSFFUTFMMFSPSBiTPSSZwUPBCFHHBSPSSFJOGPSDFB
iUIBOLZPVWFSZNVDIwUPTPNFPOFXIPTIFMQFEZPV.BOZQFPQMFJOUIFTPVUIPG
Jordan will instinctively touch their right hand to their heart after shaking hands.
One hand held out with the palm upturned and all ﬁve ﬁngertips pressed means 
wait. A side-to-side wrist-pivot of one hand at chest level, palm up with the ﬁngers 
curled, means what do you want? If someone holds their ﬂat palm out to you and 
draws a line across it with the index ﬁnger of the other hand, they're asking you for 
whatever document seems relevant at the time - usually a passport. You can make 
the same gesture to ask for the bill (check) in a restaurant.
Pointing at someone or something directly with your index ﬁnger, as you might do 
at home, in Jordan casts the evil eye; instead you should gesture imprecisely with 
two ﬁngers, or just ﬂap your whole hand in the direction you mean. Beckoning with 
your palm up has cutesy and overtly sexual connotations; instead you should 
beckon with your palm facing the ground and all four ﬁngers together making 
broom-sweeping motions towards yourself.
In all Arab cultures, knowingly showing the soles of your feet or shoes to 
someone is a direct insult. Foreigners have some leeway to err, but you should be 
aware of it when crossing your legs while sitting: crossing ankle-on-knee means 
your sole is showing to the person sitting next to you. Copying the Jordanian style 
of sitting on a chair - always keeping both feet on the ﬂoor - is safest. Sitting on the 
ﬂoor requires some foot-tucking to ensure no one is in your line of ﬁre. Putting your 
feet up on chairs or tables is not done.
Another major no-no is picking your teeth with your ﬁngers; you'd break fewer 
social taboos if you were to snort, spit into a plastic bag, jiggle a ﬁnger in your ear 
BOEQJDLZPVSOPTFJOQVCMJD.PTUEJOFSTBOESFTUBVSBOUTPGGFSUPPUIQJDLTXIJDI
should be used surreptitiously behind your palm.
BASICS | Culture and etiquette

59
presenting gifts directly will generally cause 
embarrassment, 
since 
complex 
social 
etiquette demands that such a gift be 
refused several times before acceptance. 
Instead, you can acknowledge your appreci-
ation by giving gifts to the small children: 
pens, small toys, notebooks, even picture-
postcards of your home country will endear 
you to your hosts much more than might 
appear from the monetary value of such 
things.
It's worth pointing out that you should be 
much more sparing and - above all - gener-
alized in praising your host's home and decor 
than is common in the West, since if you 
show noticeable interest in a particular piece, 
big or small, your host is obliged to give it to 
you. Mineﬁelds of complex verbal jockeyings 
to maintain dignity and family honour then 
open up if you refuse to accept the item in 
question. Many local people keep their 
reception rooms relatively bare for this 
reason.
If you're a vegetarian, you would be quite 
within social etiquette to make your dietary 
preferences clear before you accept an 
invitation. 
Especially 
in 
touristy 
areas, 
vegetarianism is accepted as a Western 
foible and there'll be no embarrassment on 
either side. Elsewhere, it can help to clarify 
what seems an extraordinary and unfamiliar 
practice by claiming it to be a religious or 
medical obligation. All their best efforts 
notwithstanding, though, veggies should 
prepare themselves to have to sit down in 
front of a steaming dish of fatty meat stew 
and tuck in heartily, while still looking like 
they're enjoying it.
During and after the meal
This section outlines some of the things 
which may happen once you sit down to 
eat with a family. It may all seem too 
daunting for words to try and remember 
everything here. The bottom line is, you 
don't: you'd have to act truly outrageously to 
offend anyone deeply. Your host would never 
be so inhospitable as to make a big deal 
about some social blunder anyway.
Once you arrive for a meal, you may be 
handed a thimbleful of bitter Arabic coffee
as a welcoming gesture; down it rapidly, 
since everyone present must drink before 
sociabilities can continue. Hand the cup 
back while jiggling your wrist: this indicates 
you don't want any more (if you just hand it 
straight back, you'll get a reﬁll). The meal - 
often a mensaf (see p.45) - may well be 
served on the ﬂoor if you're in a tent, 
generally with the head of the household, his 
adult sons and any male friends squatting on 
one knee or sitting cross-legged around a 
large communal platter; Western women 
count as males for social purposes and will 
be included in the circle. As guest of honour, 
you may be invited to sit beside the head of 
the household. Even if wives and daughters 
are present, they almost certainly won't eat 
with you, and you may ﬁnd that they all stay 
out of sight in another part of the tent or 
house for the duration of your visit. If they 
do, it would be grossly impertinent to enquire 
after them.
Once the food appears (generally served 
by the women), and the host has wished you 
"sahtayn!" 
("[May 
you 
eat] 
with 
two 
appetites!"), you should conﬁne yourself to 
eating - strictly with your right hand only - 
from that part of the platter directly in front of 
you. Your host may toss over into your 
sector choice bits of meat - probably just 
ordinary bits, but perhaps the tongue, brains 
or, as an outside possibility, the eyes - 
which, if they land in front of you, it would be 
inexplicable to refuse. It's possible that 
everyone present will share a single glass of 
water, so if the only glass visible is put in 
front of you, it's not a cue for you to down it.
While eating, locals will be careful not to 
lick their ﬁngers, instead rolling their rice 
and meat into a little ball one-handed and 
popping it in from a short distance; however, 
it takes ages to learn how to do this without 
throwing food all over yourself, and you'll 
have enough social leeway to subtly cram in 
a ﬁstful as best you can. It's no embarrass-
ment - in fact, it's almost obligatory - to 
make a horrible greasy mess of your hands 
and face. People do not linger over eating, 
and rarely pause to chat: you may ﬁnd that 
everyone chomps away more or less in 
silence.
Stop eating (or slow down) before you're 
full, partly because as soon as you stop 
you'll be tossed more food, and partly 
because no one will continue eating after 
BASICS | Culture and etiquette

60
you - the guest of honour - have stopped 
(so if you sit back too soon you'll be cutting 
the meal short). Never ﬁnish all the food in 
front of you, since not only does this tag you 
as greedy, it's also an insult to your host, 
who is obliged to keep your plate well 
stocked. Bear in mind, too, that dinner for 
the women and children is whatever the 
men (and you) leave behind.
When you've ﬁnished, your right hand 
over your heart and the words "al-hamdu-
lillah" ("thank God") make clear your 
satisfaction.
Everyone will get up and walk away to 
wash hands and face with soap, before 
adjourning to lounge on cushions, perhaps 
around the ﬁre. Coffee will be served in 
tiny handleless cups; take two or three 
before returning the cup with a jiggle of 
your wrist. Then there'll be endless glasses 
of sweet, black tea, along with bonhomie, 
conversation and possibly an argileh. It's 
your host's unspoken duty to keep the tea 
ﬂowing whatever happens, so after you've 
had enough - one or two glasses at least 
- stem the tide by saying "da'iman" ("may it 
always be thus") and then simply ignore your 
full glass.
Couples: displaying 
affection
Couples travelling together need to be 
aware of Jordanian social norms. Put simply, 
public displays of affection between men 
and women are not acceptable. Even if 
you're married, walking arm-around-waist or 
arm-over-shoulder, touching each other's 
face or body or kissing each other are likely 
to be viewed as deeply distasteful - as if you 
were bringing the intimacy of the bedroom 
into the public sphere. It is possible 
occasionally in Amman to see husbands and 
wives walking hand-in-hand, but it's rare.
Answering questions
People will be genuinely (and innocently) 
interested in you as visitors, and their 
questions may ﬂow thick and fast. Aside 
from "What's your name?" and "Where are 
you from?", you're likely to be asked about 
how many children you've got, what their 
names are, why you don't have more, and 
so on. If you have none, lissa ("later") or 
masha'allah ("according to God's will") are 
two respectful, comprehensible ways to say 
so. Other useful phrases are given on p.410. 
Having a few photos to pass around (even if 
they're digital images on a phone or camera) 
of 
children, 
parents, 
brothers, 
sisters, 
nephews and nieces can break the ice, 
should any ice need breaking. However, 
note that men never enquire after another 
man's wife - not even her name: the conver-
sation should stay strictly on work and kids.
If you're travelling as an unmarried
couple, saying "We're just good friends" 
means little and merely highlights the cultural 
divide. Being able to show a wedding/
engagement ring (a cheap fake will do), even 
if you have no nuptials planned, makes 
things instantly clear and understandable. 
See p.410 for how to say "We're getting 
married next year" in Arabic, along with 
other handy phrases. For a woman travelling 
alone, a ring - indicating an absent husband 
- is a powerful signiﬁer of respectability.
Gay and lesbian 
travellers
Homosexual acts are illegal in Jordan. 
Amman has a small underground gay
scene, for the most part invisible to 
outsiders. Social disapproval of an overtly 
gay lifestyle is strong: dalliances between 
young, unmarried men are sometimes 
understood as "letting off steam", but they 
are accepted - if at all - only as a precursor 
to the standard social model of marriage and 
plenty of kids. Although women form strong 
bonds of friendship with each other to the 
exclusion of men, public perception of lesbi-
anism is almost nonexistent, although again 
Amman has a small, word-of-mouth scene.
A by-product of the social divisions 
between men and women, though, is that 
visiting gay or lesbian couples can feel much 
freer about limited public displays of 
affection than straight couples: cheek-
kissing, 
eye-gazing 
and 
hand-holding 
between same-sex friends in public is normal 
and completely socially acceptable.
Sexual harassment
Sexual harassment of women travellers in 
Jordan is extremely rare. As outlined above, 
the single most effective way to stop it 
BASICS | Culture and etiquette

61
happening at all is to understand the 
Jordanian concept of modesty and to dress 
accordingly.
Most harassment never goes beyond the 
verbal - perhaps including hissing or making 
kissy noises - and unless you're sufﬁciently 
well versed in Arabic swear-words to 
respond in kind (worth it for the startled 
looks), it's ignorable.
A tiny fraction of incidents involve groping. 
If you take the ﬁght to your harasser, by 
pointing at him directly, shouting angrily and 
slapping away his hand, you're likely to 
shame him to his roots in front of his neigh-
bours. Accusing him of bringing himself and 
his country into public disrepute - aayib! is 
Arabic for "shame!" - is about the most 
effective dissuasive action you could take. 
Onlookers are likely to be embarrassed and 
apologetic for your having suffered harass-
ment. Unmarried or unrelated men and 
women do not touch each other in public 
(apart from possibly to shake hands in a 
formal setting), and any man who touches 
you, even on the elbow to guide you, has 
overstepped the mark and knows it.
More serious harassment - blocking your 
path or refusing to leave you alone - is even 
less likely, and assault is virtually unknown. 
In Jordan strangers are much more likely to 
help a foreigner in distress than might be the 
case at home, and in an emergency you 
shouldn't hesitate to appeal directly for help 
to shopkeepers or passers-by, or to bang 
on the nearest front door.
Shopping for crafts
Unlike Syria, Palestine and Egypt, the trading history of Jordan mostly revolves 
around goods passing through rather than being produced; no city within the 
boundaries of modern Jordan has ever come close to matching the craftsman-
ship on display in the workshops and bazaars of Aleppo, Damascus, Jerusalem 
and Cairo.
Traditionally, people in Jordan have simply 
made whatever they needed for themselves 
- carpets, jugs, jewellery - without their skills 
being noticed or valued by outside buyers. 
Today, although a handful of outlets around 
the country sell local (and some imported) 
crafts, Jordan has no Damascus-style craft 
bazaars. You may come across items of 
aesthetic value here and there, but your 
chances of picking up bargain antiques are 
very small, and any that you might come 
across almost certainly originate from 
outside Jordan. For the record, Jordanian 
law forbids the purchase of any item dating 
from before 1700.
There are only three rules of bargaining:
ﬁrst, never to start the process unless you 
want to buy; second, never, even in jest, to 
let a price pass your lips that you're not 
prepared to pay; and third, never to lose 
your temper. However, the lack of a tradition 
of bazaar-style haggling results in a reluc-
tance among Jordanian merchants even to 
embark on the process. In most everyday 
situations, you'll rapidly be brought up short 
against an unbudgeable last price - which, 
unlike in the Cairo or Damascus bazaars, 
really is the last price, take it or leave it.
Embroidery and weaving
The ﬁeld where Transjordanian people have 
the strongest tradition is in hand-embroi-
dered textiles, although up to a few 
decades ago such fabrics tended to stay 
within the conﬁnes of the town producing 
them and generally never came onto the 
open market. Embroidered jackets, dresses 
and cushion covers are now available 
BASICS | Shopping for crafts

everywhere, in both traditional and modern 
styles, but relatively few are high-quality, 
handmade items.
Sheep's wool and goat's hair have been 
used since time immemorial to weave tents, 
carpets, rugs, cushions, even food-storage 
containers, for family use; the two ﬁbres 
woven together form a waterproof barrier. 
Rarer camel hair went to make rugs. Up until 
the 1920s, natural dyes were always used: 
indigo 
(planted 
in 
the 
Jordan 
Valley), 
pomegranate, onion peel and mulberries were 
all common, as was the sumac berry (red), 
kermes insect dye (crimson), cochineal (pink), 
and even yellowish soil. Salt, vinegar or soda 
were added in order to make the colours fast.
Since the 1980s, local and international 
development projects - Save The Children 
among them - have been involved in nurturing 
traditional bedouin weaving. By doing so, 
and by establishing retail outlets in Amman 
and elsewhere for the sale of woven items, 
they have managed to rejuvenate a dying 
craft, and simultaneously create extra sources 
of income for the weavers, who are almost 
without exception rural women. The quality of 
carpets, 
rugs 
and 
home 
furnishings 
produced under these various projects is ﬁrst-
rate, although prices are concomitantly high. 
The older, more traditional colours - deep 
reds, navy blues, greens, oranges and 
blacks - as well as the traditional styles of 
stripes and diamonds, are being augmented 
these days by brighter, chemically dyed 
colours and more modern patterns, to 
appeal to a new, Western-inspired clientele, 
but there is usually a good range of tradi-
tional and modern pieces on offer. In 
Madaba, Jerash and Irbid you may see 
carpet shops featuring upright treadle looms; 
these are operated only by men, and almost 
exclusively in the cities, to produce mainly 
derivative items for sale. These have their 
own appeal, but the majority of traditionally 
designed woven pieces are made by 
women, who use only a ground loom, which 
they set up either in front of their home tent 
in springtime or at village workshops.
A more affordable woven craft is weaving
with straw, a skill of northern Jordanian 
women, to produce large multicoloured 
trays, mats, storage containers or wall-
hangings. Baskets made of local bamboo,
woven by men in Himmeh (aka Mukhaybeh) 
on the River Yarmouk, often ﬁnd their way to 
Amman for sale in crafts centres.
Jewellery
Many Jordanians have inherited their 
parents' and grandparents' preference - 
stemming partly from previous generations' 
nomadic existence, and partly from a rural 
mistrust of urban institutions - for investing 
their money in jewellery rather than in 
banks. Until recently, bedouin brides wore 
their personal wealth in silver jewellery, and 
retained the right throughout their married 
lives to do with it what they wanted, 
husbands' 
wishes 
notwithstanding. 
Owning jewellery was - and still is - 
something of a safety net for women 
against the possibility of abandonment, 
divorce or widowhood.
Traditionally, the bedouin much preferred 
silver to gold; indeed, it's just about 
impossible to ﬁnd genuine old gold in 
Jordan. The Gold Souk - a collection of 
tiny modern jewellery shops huddled 
together in Downtown Amman - has 
excellent prices, but almost everything is of 
generic modern design.
If you're after more distinctive jewellery, 
you should be aware that, although there are 
a few Jordanian designers producing new, 
hand-made items, practically all the new 
jewellery you'll see in craft shops has been 
imported from Turkey, India or Italy. Chunky 
bedouin jewellery that looks old generally 
turns out to have been made seventy or 
eighty years ago, and much old "silver" is in 
fact a mix of eighty percent silver and twenty 
percent copper. Practically all the "old" 
necklaces you might see will have been 
strung recently on nylon thread using stones 
and silver beads from long-dispersed older 
originals.
However, none of this detracts from the fact 
that beautiful and unique items are available; 
especially striking are necklaces that combine 
silver beads with beads of coloured glass, 
amber or semiprecious stones. Different 
stones have different signiﬁcances: blue 
stones protect the wearer from the evil eye, 
white stones stimulate lactation during breast-
feeding, and so on. You might also ﬁnd rare 
Circassian enamelwork, dramatically adding 
BASICS | Shopping for crafts

63
to a silver bracelet or necklace's charm. 
However, note that all precious stones in 
Jordan are imported, mostly from Turkey.
Metalwork, wood and 
glass
In Amman, copper and brass items, such as 
distinctive long-spouted dalleh coffee-pots, 
candlesticks, embossed or inlaid platters and 
the like, are generally mass-produced Indian 
and Pakistani pieces. You might ﬁnd original 
Yemeni or Iraqi curved silver daggers on 
sale, in amongst the reproductions.
Wood is a scarce resource in Jordan, and 
although you may ﬁnd some Jordanian-
carved pieces (simple cooking implements, 
mostly, of local oak and pistachio) practi-
cally all the elegant wooden furniture you'll 
come across - wardrobes, chairs, beautiful 
inlaid chests and the like - originates (and is 
much cheaper) in Syria. You might spot 
some original hand-carved wooden imple-
ments used in the bedouin coffee-making 
process, such as a mihbash, or grinder, 
and a mabradeh, an ornamented tray for 
cooling the coffee beans after roasting. 
Prices in Amman for olive-wood or 
mother-of-pearl pieces from Bethlehem or 
the famous blown glass of Hebron (now 
also made in Na'ur, just outside Amman) 
can be half what you might pay in 
Jerusalem.
Travelling with children
Children are universally loved in Jordan, and travelling with your family is likely to 
provoke spontaneous acts of kindness and hospitality from the locals.
Children are central to Jordanian society - 
many couples have four or ﬁve, and double 
ﬁgures 
isn't 
uncommon. 
Middle-class 
extended families tend to take pleasure in 
spoiling kids rotten, allowing them to stay up 
late and play endlessly, but as a counter-
point, kids from low-income families can be 
seen out on the streets at all hours selling 
cigarettes. The streets are quite safe and 
even very young children walk to school 
unaccompanied.
Only the cheapest hotels will bar children; 
most will positively welcome them (with 
deals on extra beds or adjoining rooms), as 
will all restaurants, although discounts may 
have to be negotiated. There are a few 
precautions to bear in mind. Foremost is 
the heat: kids' sensitive skin should be 
protected from the sun as much as possible, 
both in terms of clothing (brimmed hats and 
long sleeves are essential) and gallons of 
sunblock. Heatstroke and dehydration can 
work much faster on children than on adults. 
Sunglasses with full UV protection are vital to 
protect sensitive eyes. Kids are also more 
vulnerable than adults to stomach upsets:
you should deﬁnitely carry rehydration salts 
in case of diarrhoea. Other things to watch 
out for include the crazy trafﬁc (especially for 
British kids, who'll be used to cars driving on 
the other side of the road), stray animals that 
may be disease carriers, and jellyﬁsh and 
poisonous corals off Aqaba's beaches.
Children will love riding camels in Wadi 
Rum, and even Petra's threadbare donkeys 
may hold an appeal. Most of the archeolog-
ical sites will probably be too rareﬁed to be 
of more than passing interest (aside, 
possibly, from exploring towers and under-
ground passages at Karak, Shobak or Ajloun 
castles); spotting vultures, ibex and blue 
lizards at Dana or Mujib may be a better bet, 
and the glass-bottomed boats at Aqaba are 
perennial favourites. Children born and 
brought up in urban environments will 
probably never have experienced anything 
like the vastness and silence of the open 
desert, and you may ﬁnd they're transﬁxed 
by the emptinesses of Wadi Rum or the 
eastern Badia.

Addresses
Notwithstanding the efforts of cartographers 
and government ofﬁcials, Jordan doesn't 
use street addresses: nameplates you see 
on street corners are largely ignored by 
locals, who navigate either in relation to 
prominent landmarks or by asking passers-
by. Mail is delivered only to PO boxes at 
post ofﬁces. If you have an appointment, it's 
a good idea to phone in advance to get 
detailed directions.
Costs
By Western standards, Jordan is a good-
value destination. It's possible to see the 
sights, eat adequately, sleep in basic 
comfort and get around on public transport 
for roughly £40/US$60 a day. If you like 
things more comfortable - staying in good 
mid-range hotels, eating well, perhaps 
renting a car to see some out-of-the-way 
places - reckon on nearer £75/US$115 a 
day per person. To travel independently 
while hiring drivers and guides, staying in 
ﬁve-star hotels and generally living the high 
life, aim for £150/US$225 a day per 
person.
Jordan has a government sales tax,
which applies at different rates, depending 
on the goods/services involved, up to 
about 14 percent: bear in mind that, in 
many situations, the price you see (or are 
told) doesn't include this tax, which is only 
added on when you come to pay. In 
Aqaba, sales tax is lower than the rest of 
Jordan. In addition, hotels and restaurants 
above a certain quality threshold automati-
cally add a ten percent service charge to 
all bills. They are legally obliged to state 
these charges somewhere, although it can 
be as surreptitious as a tiny line on the 
bottom of a menu, or just a simple "++" 
attached to a hotel price-list, as in "Double 
Room JD60++". If you try to bargain, you'll 
often ﬁnd the "plus-plus" suddenly disap-
pearing from view. 
Crime and personal 
safety
The sense of honour and hospitality to guests 
embedded deep within Arab culture, coupled 
with a respect for others, means that you're 
extremely unlikely to become a victim of 
crime while in Jordan. Along with the ordinary 
police, Jordan maintains a force of English-
speaking tourist police, identiﬁable by their 
armbands with English lettering. Posted at all 
tourist sites nationwide, they can deal with 
requests, complaints or problems of harass-
ment. Any representation by a foreigner, 
whether to the tourist police or the ordinary 
local police, will generally have you ushered 
into the presence of senior ofﬁcers, sat down 
and plied with coffee, with your complaint 
taken in the utmost seriousness. The nation-
wide police emergency number is T191.
Terrorism and civil disorder in Jordan are 
extremely rare. The political and religious 
make-up of Jordanian society - as well as 
the invisible grip of the security services - 
makes domestic terrorism exceptionally 
unlikely. All big hotels have barriers keeping 
vehicles clear of the entrance, and airport-
style security for everyone entering the 
building (including compulsory baggage 
X-ray and body search). Armed police patrol 
all major tourist sites. Regardless of the 
impression you might get from the nightly 
news, you'd be in no more danger travelling 
round Jordan than you would be in your 
home country.
Customs and duty-free
You're permitted to buy 200 cigarettes, one 
litre of spirits and two litres of wine duty-free
on arrival in the country. All borders and 
airports have duty-free shops open long 
hours, but if you forget to buy your allowance 
of alcohol, cigarettes, perfume and/or 
electronic goods when you arrive, you can 
go to the Duty-Free Shop on Tunis Street 
near 5th Circle in Amman (T06 567 8147) 
within 14 days, where the whole range is 
available. Bring your passport.

The area around Aqaba is a Special
Economic Zone, with lower taxes and its 
own customs rules: on all roads into the city, 
you'll have to pass through a customs 
station. On departing the zone, there are 
Red and Green Channels, as in an airport. 
Personal items, up to 200 cigarettes and one 
litre of alcohol that you bought in the zone 
are exempt from duty.
Electricity
The supply in Jordan is 220V AC, 50Hz - 
the same as in Europe. Most new buildings 
and big hotels have British-style square 
three-pin sockets. Older buildings tend to 
have two-pin sockets for European-style 
thick-pronged, round plugs.
Entry requirements
All visitors to Jordan must hold passports 
valid for at least six months beyond the 
proposed date of entry to the country. On 
arrival at all airports, as well as at all land 
and sea borders - apart from the King 
Hussein/Allenby Bridge - most nationalities 
are routinely issued with a single-entry 
visa. If you arrive at Aqaba, it's free (see 
below); if you arrive anywhere else, it 
costs JD10.
(Note that citizens of certain developing 
countries cannot obtain a visa on arrival 
and must instead apply at the nearest 
Jordanian embassy at least three months 
prior to travel. A full list of these is at 
Wwww.visitjordan.com.)
If you plan to enter Jordan for the ﬁrst time 
via the King Hussein/Allenby Bridge, you 
must already hold a visa. If, however, you left 
Jordan via this bridge and are returning the 
same way, you don't need to buy another 
visa as long as your current one is still valid.
For groups of ﬁve or more people, whose 
journey has been arranged by a travel agent 
and who intend to stay in Jordan for at least 
two nights, visa fees are waived. A multiple-
entry visa costs roughly twice the price of a 
single-entry - the equivalent of £21/US$31 - 
but 
is 
available 
only 
from 
Jordanian 
embassies and consulates.
Both single- and multiple-entry visas are 
valid for a stay of thirty days. If you're 
planning to stay longer than that, you must 
register with the police in the last couple of 
days before the thirty-day period is up - a 
simple, free, ﬁve-minute procedure which 
grants a three-month extension.
Always carry your passport on your 
person: you'll need it to check into hotels 
and to ease your way through any 
checkpoints.
Visas at Aqaba
If you enter Jordan at Aqaba - which stands 
at the centre of the Aqaba Special 
Economic Zone (ASEZ) - you are granted a 
free 30-day visa on arrival at Aqaba's airport, 
seaport or the land crossings from Israel 
(Eilat) or Saudi Arabia (Durra). You are then 
free to travel around Jordan as you like. 
Staying more than a month involves

extending an ASEZ visa, which can be done 
only at the ofﬁces of ASEZA (Aqaba Special 
Economic Zone Authority) in Aqaba itself. If 
you arrive in Jordan elsewhere - other than 
the King Hussein/Allenby Bridge - and you 
let the passport ofﬁcials know that you intend 
to go directly to Aqaba, you are entitled to 
get a free ASEZ visa rather than a standard 
JD10 visa. In these cases, though, you must 
register at the ASEZA ofﬁces in Aqaba 
within 48 hours of your arrival in Jordan: if 
you miss this deadline, you become liable for 
the cost of the visa plus a ﬁne. 
Health
No immunizations or vaccinations are 
required before you can enter Jordan. 
However, before you travel, it's strongly 
recommended that you make sure you're up 
to date with immunizations against hepatitis 
A, polio, tetanus (lockjaw), tuberculosis and 
typhoid fever. You should consult a doctor at 
least two months in advance of your 
departure date, as there are some immuni-
zations that can't be given at the same time, 
and several take a while to become effective.

Dehydration
Top of the list of Jordan's maladies, well 
ahead of the worst creepy-crawlies, is 
dehydration, which can work insidiously 
over days to weaken you to the point of 
exhaustion without your ever showing any 
signs of illness. Equally - and just as danger-
ously - if you're sweating profusely during 
activity (such as hiking), even experienced 
walkers can go from alert and vigorous to 
dizzy and apathetic in as little as half an hour, 
due solely to loss of body ﬂuids. It is essential 
to carry lots of water with you on these 
walks: one bottle is not enough.
An adult should normally drink two litres of 
water a day; from day one in the Middle 
East, you should be drinking at least three 
litres - and, if you're exerting yourself in hot 
conditions, more than double that. It's a 
matter of pride among the desert bedouin 
not to drink water in front of foreigners, but if 
you copy them you're likely to make yourself 
ill. Drinking to quench your thirst just isn't 
enough in a hot climate, since the combina-
tion of the sun's evaporation and your own 
sweating can pull water out of your system 
far quicker than your body can deliver thirst 
messages to your brain: you must drink well 
beyond thirst-quenching if you're to head off 
the lethargy and splitting headaches - and 
potentially serious physical and mental 
incapacity - caused by dehydration. Alcohol
and
caffeine exacerbate the effects of 
dehydration.
Travellers' diarrhoea
If you arrive in Jordan directly from the West 
(or Israel), give your stomach a chance to 
acclimatize: avoid street food for a few days 
and spend a little extra to eat in posher, but 
cleaner, restaurants. Every eating place, from 
the diviest diner upwards, will have a sink 
with soap for washing your hands. Nonethe-
less, few travellers seem to avoid diarrhoea
altogether. Instant recourse to drugs such 
as Imodium or Lomotil that plug you up (in 
fact, what they do is paralyse your gut) is not 
advisable; you should only use them if you 
absolutely must travel (eg if you're ﬂying). 
The best thing to do is to wait, eat nothing 
for at least 24 hours and let it run its course, 
while constantly replacing the ﬂuids and salts 
that you're ﬂushing away. Maintaining ﬂuid 
intake (even if it all rushes out again) is vitally 
important. Oral rehydration solutions such 
as Dioralyte or Electrosol are widely available 
worldwide, sold in sachets for dissolving in a 
glassful of clean water. They're marketed as 
being for babies, but will make you feel 
better and stronger than any other treatment. 
If you can't get the sachets, make up your 
own solution with one heaped teaspoon of 
salt and twelve level teaspoons of sugar 
added to a standard-sized (1.5-litre) bottle of 
mineral water. You need to keep downing 
the stuff, whether or not the diarrhoea is 
continuing - at least a litre of the solution per 
day interspersed with three litres of fresh 
water. Bouts of diarrhoea rarely last longer 
than 24-48 hours.

If it goes on for longer than four days, seek 
medical advice. Nasty but easily treatable 
diseases such as giardiasis and amoebiasis 
must be tested for by a stool examination. If 
there is blood in your diarrhoea, you've most 
likely got dysentery and must see a doctor.
Heat exhaustion and sunstroke
The Jordanian sun can be scorchingly 
intense, and - obvious though it sounds - 
you should do all you can to avoid sun 
exposure, especially if you're travelling in 
high summer (May-Sept). Head protection is 
essential. Lightweight 100 percent cotton 
clothes - such as long-sleeved shirts, and 
long trousers or ankle-length skirts - will 
allow air to circulate close to your skin to 
keep you cool and limit both sunburn and 
dehydration. If you feel very hot, dizzy and 
faint but aren't sweating, you may have 
sunstroke: get out of direct sun immediately, 
and into air conditioning and/or cold water 
as soon as possible. Call a doctor.
Bites and stings
Malaria is not present in Jordan - though 
mosquitoes and sandﬂies are. Snakes are 
frightened of humans; if you walk slowly and 
noisily, any snakes present will slither away. 
To avoid tangling with scorpions and 
spiders never walk barefoot, and if you're 
camping always shake out your shoes and 
clothes before wearing them.
Treatment in Jordan
Every town has a pharmacy (saydaliyyeh),
generally staffed by ﬂuent English-speaking 
professionals trained to Western standards. 
Unless you're obviously a hospital case, 
these are where you should head ﬁrst, since 
a pharmacist charges nothing for a "consul-
tation", and can either prescribe a remedy 
on the spot or refer you to a local doctor. If 
you're given a medicine, ﬁnd out explicitly 
from the pharmacist what the dosage is, 
since printed English information on the box 
might be sketchy.
If you need a doctor (doktoor), ask your 
embassy to recommend one or check ﬁrst 
with a pharmacist. All doctors are trained in 
English, many in hospitals in the UK or US. If 
you're in real trouble, aim for the emergency 
room of a hospital (moostashfa) - and call 
the emergency helpline of your embassy 
(see p.65) to ask for advice. Consultation 
fees and medical costs are much lower than 
back home, but you should still get signed 
receipts for everything in order to claim 
money back from your insurance company 
when you return.
Insurance
It's essential to take out a good travel
insurance policy to cover against theft, loss 
of property and illness or injury. Before 
paying for a new policy, however, it's worth 
checking whether you are already covered: 
home insurance may cover your possessions 
when overseas, many private medical 
schemes include cover when abroad and 
premium bank accounts and/or credit cards 
often have travel insurance included. After 
exhausting these possibilities, contact a 
specialist travel insurance ﬁrm. Rough 
Guides offers tailor-made travel insurance 
through Columbus Direct, including a low-
cost backpacker option, a short break 
option, a typical holiday option, and others. 
Sports and activities, such as trekking or 
diving, can usually be included. See Wwww
.roughguides.com/shop - or call UK T0870

T0800 559 911, or worldwide T+44 870 
890 2843.
Mail
Airmail letters and postcards can take a 
week or two to Western Europe, up to a 
month to North America or Australasia. 
Asking someone to write the destination 
country in Arabic can help avoid things going 
astray. It's safest to ignore the street 
postboxes and instead send your mail from 
larger post ofﬁces, all of which have a box 
for airmail (barid jowwy). Stamps (tawabe'a)
cost well under JD1, but parcels are 
expensive (JD10-15 for 1kg). International 
courier ﬁrms are well represented in Amman 
and Aqaba.
Maps

book should be adequate. Many interna-
tional map publishers cover Jordan, but few

and/or mark villages or archeological sites 
inaccurately. The GeoProjects 1:730,000 
map (third edition or later) leaves out some 
detail but is probably the best available 
outside Jordan. Other maps, including city 
maps and plans for Petra and other sites, 
are available in Jordan, many produced by 
the Royal Jordanian Geographic Centre 
(Wwww.rjgc.gov.jo).
Money
The Jordanian unit of currency is the dinar,
abbreviated to JD. Most people refer to the 
dinar as a "jaydee" or a "lira". There are two 
subdivisions: one dinar comprises either 
1000 ﬁls or 100 piastres (qirsh). Locals 
always think in piastres; they only refer to ﬁls 
when talking to foreigners. A hotel, restau-
rant or shop bill will show either "14.65" or 
"14.650", both of which mean 14 dinars and 
65 piastres (that is, 650 ﬁls). In this book, we 
are sticking to two decimal places only.
Banknotes are JD50, JD20, JD10, JD5 
and JD1, all with Arabic on one side and 
English on the other. For coins, there's a 
gold, seven-sided half-dinar coin inset with 
a circular silver bit in the middle; a smaller 
quarter-dinar coin, also gold and seven-
sided but without the silver inset; and silver 
coins of ten piastres and ﬁve piastres.
Coppers 
of 
one 
piastre 
are 
virtually 
worthless. Note that ten-piastre coins are the 
same size, weight and value as older 100 ﬁls
coins which are still in circulation. Similarly, 
ﬁve-piastre coins have an identical twin, 
marked as 50 ﬁls. All coins state their value 
on them somewhere in tiny English lettering.
In verbal exchanges, you'll ﬁnd that people 
quite often leave the denomination off the 
end of prices. If they say something costs 
"ashreen" (twenty), it's up to you to decide 
whether they mean 20 ﬁls (a throwaway 
amount), 20 piastres (ie 200 ﬁls; the price of 
a street snack or a short bus ride), or 20 JDs 
(the cost of a double room in a small hotel). 
Nicknames also pop up: 10 piastres is a 
barizeh and 5 piastres is a shilin.
Changing and carrying money
Few banks in the West keep Jordanian 
dinars on hand, but you should be able to 
order them with a few days' notice. It's a 
good idea to bring JD50 or so with you in 
cash, to cover visa and transport costs on 
arrival.
Most hotels and shops above the cheapest 
level accept plastic, but Jordan is a cash 
society: just about everywhere the preferred 
method of payment is local currency. 
Security-wise, Jordan is safer than anywhere 
in the West: you can carry wads of cash 
around in your pocket on a crowded rush-
hour bus or at 2am in a dark alley without 
concern. You're more likely to be invited for 
tea than mugged.
There's no black market in currency 
exchange. For changing cash or traveller's 
cheques (in all major currencies), every town 
has a welter of banks, with identical 
exchange rates, and there are also plenty of 
independent change ofﬁces. Cash machines 
(ATMs) are widespread, always with an 
English option.
Opening hours and public 
holidays
Normal ofﬁce hours are Sunday to Thursday 
8.30am to 3.30pm. Jordan's weekend is
Friday and Saturday; this is when public 
sector ofﬁces (such as government depart-
ments) are closed. However, private sector 
businesses may run a six-day week, closing 
only on Fridays. If somebody tells you a 
particular attraction is open "every day", 
quite often they mean every day except 
Friday.
Although Muslims pray together in the 
mosque on a Friday, the concept of a 
"sabbath" or "day of rest" does not translate: 
downtown shops and markets are generally 
open seven days a week, roughly 8 or 9am 
to 8 or 9pm, though some more upmarket 
shops might close for two or three hours in 
the middle of the afternoon, and almost 
everywhere shuts for an hour or two around 
Friday 
midday 
prayers. 
All 
transport
services operate seven days a week.
During Ramadan, the Muslim holy month 
of fasting, everything changes. Shops and 
ofﬁces open from 9am to 2 or 3pm (closed 
Fri), while street markets operate every day 
until about an hour before sunset. Banks and 
government departments may only be open 
for two or three hours in the morning. Some 
shops might re-open for a couple of hours 
after dark.

Fixed public holidays
Jordan's secular national holidays tend to 
be low-key affairs, involving limited celebra-
tions and/or military parades; government 
ofﬁces are closed, but shops and businesses 
often open as normal. The exception is the 
king's birthday, which can involve a three- or 
four-day break in the last week of January.
Jordan's Christians are mostly Orthodox 
and follow the Julian calendar, which varies 
from the Gregorian calendar used in the 
West by a couple of weeks. Nevertheless, 
everyone has agreed to celebrate Christmas 
Day together on December 25, and since 
1994 that date has been marked as a 
national holiday (although Muslim shops and 
businesses are open as normal).
Jan 1 New Year's Day
Jan 30 King Abdullah's Birthday
May 1 Labour Day
May 25 Independence Day
June 9-10 Accession Day & Army Day

Islamic holidays and Ramadan
Islamic religious holidays, based on the 
Hijra calendar, are marked by widespread 
public observance. All shops and ofﬁces are 
closed and non-essential services are liable 
to be suspended. See p.396 for more info. 
The following dates are approximate, since 
each holiday is announced only when the 
moon has been seen clearly by an author-
ized cleric from Jordan's Ministry of Islamic 
Affairs. Quoted dates could vary by a couple 
of days. The start of the holy month of 
Ramadan is also included here; Ramadan is 
not a holiday, but since it comprises 30 days 
of restricted business hours, its ﬁrst day is a 
useful date to know.

less. Topping up with scratch-cards (buyable 
everywhere) is straightforward. Calling and 
texting is very inexpensive - much cheaper 
than relying on roaming with your home 
network. Basic handsets can be had for 
perhaps JD20-30.
Smoking
Smoking is banned in public places, 
including airports, museums and on public 
transport. However, enforcement is minimal 
and in effect it's impossible to escape 
cigarette smoke anywhere in the country.
Time
Jordan is usually two hours ahead of London, 
seven hours ahead of New York and eight 
hours behind Sydney. Daylight Saving Time
operates from the last Friday in March to the 
last Friday in October. For full details, check 
Wwww.timeanddate.com.
Tipping
In a good restaurant, even when a service 
charge is included, it's customary to round 
the bill up slightly as well. Low-budget local 
diners don't expect tips and will never 
press you for anything. In most everyday 
situations a quarter-dinar tip (ie JD0.25) is 
a perfectly satisfactory indication of your 
appreciation for a service, such as a hotel 
porter loading your bags onto a bus or taxi. 
Taxi-drivers deserve ten percent of the 
meter charge; if a driver has spent half a 
day shuttling you from place to place, JD5 
is in order. An appropriate tip for a bellboy 
in a four- or ﬁve-star hotel who brings your 
bags up to your room would be half a dinar 
(JD0.50) - or JD1 if you're feeling 
generous. See p.54 for guidance on tipping 
specialist guides.
Tourist information
The Jordan Tourism Board (JTB), part 
afﬁliated to the Ministry of Tourism and part 
private, publicizes the country's tourist 
assets abroad. In most countries, the 
account for handling promotion of Jordan 
is awarded to a local PR company, so 
contact details (see below) can, and do, 
change.

The best option is to plump for an organized
tour - sightseeing is liable to be complicated 
enough that leaving the practical details to 
the professionals will take a weight off your 
mind. Throughout the country pavements 
are either narrow and broken or missing 
altogether, kerbs are high, stairs are ubiqui-
tous and wheelchair access to hotels, 
restaurants and public buildings is pretty 
much nonexistent. Hotel staff and tourism 
ofﬁcials, although universally helpful, are 
generally poorly informed about the needs 
and capabilities of tourists with limited 
mobility. Travelling with an able-bodied 
helper and being able to pay for things like a 
rental car (or a car plus driver) and good 
hotels will make things easier. 
All Jordan's ancient sites are accessible 
only by crossing rough and stony ground. 
Scrambling around at Jerash or Karak is 
hard enough for those with full mobility; for 
those without, a visit represents a major 
effort of energy and organization. Petra has 
better access: with advance planning, you 
could arrange to rent a horse-drawn cart to 
take you from the ticket gate into the ancient 
city, from where - with written permission 
obtained ahead of time from the tourist 
police - you could be picked up in a car and 
driven back to your hotel.

Amman
C
onsistently overlooked and underrated by travellers to the Middle East, 
the Jordanian capital AMMAN stands in marked contrast to its raucous 
neighbours, with none of the grand history of Damascus, not a whiff of 
Jerusalem's tension and just a tiny fraction of Cairo's monuments. It's a 
civilized, genial city with unexpected charm, that is bathed in a new spirit of 
dynamism: investment is pouring in, new buildings are going up, neighbour-
hoods are being rejuvenated and the city is humming with cafés, galleries and 
commerce. If you're dreaming of medieval mosques, gloomy spice bazaars and 
fading romance, go elsewhere; if you want a handle on how a young, buzzy Arab 
capital is making its way in the world, Amman is for you.
Amman is a thoroughly twentieth-century invention: it was no more than an 
unregarded, muddy farming village when Emir Abdullah chose it to be his new 
capital in 1921. The sense of Amman being a village-made-good is highlighted 
when you spend some time on the busy Downtown streets. Here the weight of 
history that is a constant presence in the heart of many Middle Eastern cities is 
manifestly lacking, replaced instead by a quick-witted self-reliance. This energy 
stems in large part from displacement, with most Ammanis identifying 
themselves as originating somewhere else: Circassians, Iraqis and above all Pales-
tinians have arrived in the city in large numbers, voluntarily or forcibly exiled 
from their homelands. The distinctive cultures they have brought are still 
jostling for living space with the culture of the native bedouin. Indeed, 
scratching beneath Amman's amiable surface reveals a whole cluster of multiple 
personalities jockeying for supremacy: Western-educated entrepreneurs make 
their fortunes cheek-by-jowl with poverty-stricken refugees, Christians live 
next door to Muslims, conservative Islamists and radical secularists tut at each 
other's doings, Jordanians of Palestinian origin assert their identity in the face of 
nationalistic tendencies among "true" Jordanians, and so on. What it is to be 
Ammani is an ongoing dispute that shows no signs of resolution.
For the time-pressed ruin-hunter, then, there's little more than an after-
noon's sightseeing to be done; however, if you're on a long, slow journey of 
familiarity you could easily spend days exploring the slopes of Amman's 
towering hills, getting under the city's skin while seeing nothing in particular. 
The capital's impressive Roman Theatre and eighth-century Umayyad 
Palace are the only significant monumental attractions, augmented by the 
national museum, but of equal, if not greater, interest is contemporary 
Amman's burgeoning arts scene. The arts centre of Darat al-Funun, the 
National Gallery and regular music events can add a surprising perspective 
to your experience of the city's life.

Some history
The first known settlement near Amman dates from over nine thousand years 
ago, a Neolithic farming town near the Ain Ghazal spring in the hills to the 
northeast of the modern city. This was one of the largest such towns discovered 
in the region, three times bigger than contemporary Jericho. Artisans from 
among its two thousand inhabitants produced strikingly beautiful human busts 
and figurines in limestone and plaster, some of the earliest statuettes ever discov-
ered (now on display in the Amman museum).
Around 1800 BC, during the Bronze Age, the hill now known as Jebel 
al-Qal'a, which overlooks the central valley of Amman, was fortified for the 
first time. According to Genesis, the area was inhabited by giants before the 
thirteenth-century BC arrival of the Ammonites, mythical descendants 
(along with the Moabites) of the drunken seduction of Lot by his own two 
daughters. By 1200 BC, the citadel on Jebel al-Qal'a had been renamed 
Rabbath Ammon (Great City of the Ammonites) and was capital of an 
amply defended area which extended from the Zarqa to the Mujib rivers. 
Rabbath - or Rabbah - is mentioned many times in the Old Testament; the 
earliest reference, in Deuteronomy, reports that, following a victory in battle, 
the city had seized as booty the great iron bed of King Og, last of the giants. 
Later, the book of Samuel relates that, around 1000 BC, the Israelite King 
David sent messengers to Rabbah with condolences for the death of the 
Ammonite king. Unfortunately, the Ammonites suspected the messengers were 
spies: they shaved off half their beards, shredded their garments and sent them 
home in ignominy. In response to such a profound insult, David sent his entire 
army against Rabbah, although he himself stayed behind in Jerusalem to 
develop his ongoing friendship with Bathsheba, who soon became pregnant. 
On David's orders, her husband Uriah was placed in the front line of battle 
against Rabbah and killed. David then travelled to Rabbah to aid the conquest, 
threw the surviving Ammonites into slavery and returned home to marry the 
handily widowed Bathsheba. Their first child died, but their second, Solomon, 
lived to become king of Israel.
Day-trips from Amman
Distances in Jordan are small, and it's easy to base yourself in Amman and make a 
series of day-trips out to a number of nearby attractions. The main draw is ﬂoating your 
day away at the unmissable Dead Sea (p.129); you could combine this with a visit to 
the nearby Baptism Site of Jesus (p.137). Alternatively, the amiable old town of 
Madaba (see p.221) is within easy reach - and, with your own transport, you could 
construct a gentle, circular day-trip from Amman to Madaba, then the Mount Nebo 
mosaics, then the Dead Sea (with or without the Baptism Site), and back to Amman. If 
you start early, and maintain a reasonable pace, this circuit is also possible by bus.
A pleasant day-trip into the hilly countryside west of Amman could take in the 
Hellenistic palace of Qasr al-Abd (p.149) and the adjacent caves and crafts 
workshops of Iraq al-Amir, the beautiful old Ottoman capital of Salt (p.145) and a 
meal or a stroll in the lanes of old Fuheis (p.148).
North of Amman, the Roman ruins at Jerash (p.154) make for a great half-day 
excursion, set in some lovely rolling countryside. Combine Jerash with a visit to 
Ajloun castle (p.167) to make a day of it.
East of Amman, a circuit of roads takes in the fascinating so-called "Desert
Castles" (p.195) - this is easy to do by taxi or your own vehicle, but impossible on 
public transport.

The feud simmered for centuries, with Israel and Judea coveting the wealth 
gathered from lucrative trade routes by Ammon and its southern neighbours, 
Moab and Edom. In the absence of military or economic might, Israel resorted 
to the power of prophecy. "The days are coming," warned Jeremiah in the sixth 
century BC, "that a trumpet blast of war will be heard against Rabbah of 
Ammon." The city was to become "a desolate heap" with fire "destroying the 
palaces". In a spitting rage at the Ammonites' celebration of the Babylonian 
conquest of Jerusalem in 587 BC, Ezekiel went one better, prophesying that 
Rabbah was to be occupied by bedouin and to become "a stable for camels".
After Alexander the Great conquered the region in 332 BC, his successor 
Ptolemy II Philadelphus rebuilt Rabbah and named it Philadelphia, the "city 
of brotherly love". Turmoil reigned following the Seleucid takeover in 218 BC 
until the Romans restored order by creating the province of Syria in 63 BC. 
Philadelphia was at its zenith as the southernmost of the great Decapolis cities 
(see p.156), and benefited greatly from improved trade and communications 
along the Via Nova Traiana, completed in 114 AD by Emperor Trajan to link 
the provincial capital Bosra with the Red Sea. The Romans completely 
replanned Philadelphia and constructed grand public buildings, among them 
two theatres, a nymphaeum, a temple to Hercules and a huge forum, all of 
which survive.
In Byzantine times, Philadelphia was the seat of a bishopric and was still a 
regional centre when the Arabs conquered it in 635; the city's name reverted to 
Amman under the Damascus-based Umayyad dynasty. Amman became a 
regional capital and, around 720, its Umayyad governor expanded the Roman 
buildings surviving on Jebel al-Qal'a into an elaborate palatial complex, which 
promptly collapsed in the great earthquake of 749. Following the Abbasid 
takeover shortly afterwards, power shifted east to Baghdad and Amman's 
influence began to wane, although it continued to serve as a stop for pilgrims 
on the way south to Mecca. Over the next centuries, travellers mention an 
increasingly desolate town; by the time Circassian refugees were settled here 
by the Ottomans in the 1870s, Amman's hills served only as pastureland for the 
local bedouin - Ezekiel's furious prophecy come true. The Circassians, however, 
Amman's annual festivals
Amman's biggest annual event is the Jordan Festival; see p.157 for details. The 
Amman Summer Festival is held from mid-July to mid-August in the King Hussein 
Park, featuring DJs, dance troupes, music shows and a kids' zone with puppetry, face-
painting and more. As part of the summer festival, "Amman Stairs" comprises informal 
evenings of music and art staged on some of the staircases that climb the hills of 
Amman's older neighbourhoods, including Jebel al-Lweibdeh and Jebel al-Qal'a.
The Amman International Theatre Festival (Wwww.alfawanees.com) in March 
stages experimental drama from around the world in Arabic and English; the Franco-
Arab Film Festival (Wwww.lecentre-jo.org) in July hosts screenings of French/Arab 
ﬁlms alongside music and cultural events; late August sees the European Street Art 
Festival, featuring urban art and street theatre around the city; while in November, 
the European Film Festival (Wwww.euﬁlmfestivaljordan.com) screens art-house 
cinema and the Jordan Short Film Festival (Wwww.jordanﬁlmfestival.com) focuses 
on short ﬁlms from around the world. December's Amman Stand-Up Comedy 
Festival (Wwww.ammancity.gov.jo) showcases local and international talent, with 
some events in English.

revived the city's fortunes, and when the Emirate of Transjordan was estab-
lished in 1921, Emir Abdullah chose Amman to be its capital.
Modern Amman
Up to 1948, Amman comprised only a village of closely huddled houses in the 
valleys below Jebel al-Qal'a, with a handful of buildings on the lower slopes of 
the surrounding hills. But in that year Palestinians, escaping or ejected from 
the newly established State of Israel, doubled the city's population in just two 
weeks. Makeshift camps to house the refugees were set up on the outskirts, and, 
following another huge influx of Palestinian refugees from the West Bank, 
occupied by Israel in 1967, creeping development began to merge the camps 
with the city's sprawling new suburbs.
A fundamental shift in Amman's fortunes came with the outbreak of the 
Lebanese civil war in 1975. Before then, Beirut had been the financial, 
cultural and intellectual capital of the Middle East, but when hostilities broke 
out, many financial institutions relocated their regional headquarters to the 
security of Amman. Most subsequently departed to the less parochial Gulf, but 
they nonetheless brought with them money, and with the money came Western 
influence: today there are parts of West Amman indistinguishable from upscale 
neighbourhoods of American or European cities, with broad leafy avenues lined 
with mansions, and fast multi-lane freeways swishing past strip malls and glass 
office buildings. A third influx of Palestinians - this time expelled from Kuwait 
following the 1991 Gulf War - again bulged the city at its seams, squeezing 
ever more urban sprawl along the roads out to the northwest and southwest. 
When King Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, ending a state 
of war that had persisted since 1948, many Ammanis hoped for the opening of 
a new chapter in the city's life; Amman's intimate links with Palestinian markets 
and its generally Western-oriented business culture led many to believe wealth 
and commerce - not to mention Western aid - would start to flow. Building 
development burgeoned across the city, but for several years many of the new 
hotels and office buildings were white elephants, with Amman seeing little 
economic comeback from political rapprochement with Israel.
Since the early years of this century that situation has changed. Substantial 
quantities of US aid are starting to have an effect. Jordan's political and 
economic institutions are strengthening. With the government's increasing 
liberalization of the economy, confidence in Amman as a city on the up is 
growing. Private sector investment has rocketed, much of it coming instead 
from Arab countries. With a carefully nurtured international image as the 
moderate and hospitable face of the modern Arab world - an image that rings 
true for visitors - Amman today can be said to enjoy a greater influence in the 
region and the world than at any time since the Romans.
Orientation
Amman is a city of hills, and any map of the place can only give half the story. 
Although distances may look small on paper, the reality is that traffic and people 
are funnelled along streets often laid on valley-beds or clinging to the side of 
steep hills: to reach any destinations above Downtown you'll generally have to 
zigzag up sharp gradients.
The area known in English as Downtown, in Arabic as il-balad (literally "the 
city"), is the historical core of Amman; Roman Philadelphia lies beneath its 
streets and as late as the 1940s this small area comprised virtually the whole of

the city. Downtown forms a slender T-shape nestling in the valleys between six 
hills. At the joint of the T, and the heart of the city, is the imposing Husseini
Mosque, which faces along King Faysal Street, the commercial centre of 
Downtown and home to most of its budget hotels. The other main thorough-
fare of Downtown - Hashmi Street and King Talal Street, together forming the 
cross-piece of the T - runs in front of the mosque, passing to the west most of 
Amman's street markets, and to the east the huge Roman Theatre. Towering 
over Downtown are several hills, including Jebel al-Qal'a ("Citadel Hill"), site 
of a partly restored Umayyad Palace.
Amman's wealth is concentrated in upmarket West Amman; other districts 
to the north, south and east are poorer and more populous. The various neigh-
bourhoods of Jebel Amman form the heart of the city's rich western quarter. 
Running along the crest of the ridge is Zahran Street, the main east-west 
traffic artery, punctuated by numbered intersections known as "circles" (not all 
of them are roundabouts, and most feature overpasses and/or multi-level, 
Street names
Street names in Amman are a relatively recent innovation. For decades, the city 
survived without them: people simply named streets after local landmarks. Under a 
recent mayoral initiative, every street has now been given a name, which appears in 
Arabic and English on prominent signs. Yet the new system will take a few years to 
bed in, and some anomalies remain. Probably the most confusing thing for visitors is 
that the sequence of major trafﬁc intersections along Zahran Street on Jebel Amman 
- known to everyone as 1st Circle, 2nd Circle, and so on - are labelled instead with 
the names of royals and politicians. Our list below decodes them, and a few others.
Sharia is "street" and always precedes the name. Both duwaar (circle) and maydan
(square) are used to mean "trafﬁc intersection". Many streets are named after royals: 
al-malek is "King" and al-malka or al-malekah is "Queen". Similarly, al-amir or 
al-ameer is "Prince" and al-ameera "Princess" - so "Prince Muhammad Street" 
translates as Sharia al-Amir Muhammad.

art galleries. Lweibdeh abuts the district known as Abdali, currently being trans-
formed into a new business district centred on a cluster of skyscrapers. Above 
Abdali lies Shmeisani, one of the city's liveliest commercial areas, sprinkled with 
restaurants and pavement cafés. Beyond here, the northwestern suburbs dribble 
on for miles out to Jordan University. South of Shmeisani, Sweifiyyeh, the 
city's most upscale shopping district, lies below 6th Circle - fittingly close to the 
lavish mansions of Abdoun, residence of most of Jordan's millionaires.
Within spitting distance of Abdoun's villas, the Wadi Abdoun valley marks a 
division between rich West Amman and poor East Amman - of which Muhaji-
reen and Ras al-Ain are closest to Downtown, the latter hosting the national 
museum.
Arrival
Amman's many points of arrival are far-flung, and unless you opt for the 
simplicity of a taxi you'll nearly always have a rather involved onward journey 
across the city to reach a hotel. However, one thing you can always count on is 
a generally helpful attitude from bystanders. The worst that might happen to 
you on your first day in Amman would be an overabundance of offers of help 
or a slightly inflated taxi fare.
By air
Amman has two airports, but all intercontinental traffic comes into the main 
Queen Alia International Airport - see the box opposite for full information.
Marka Airport (otherwise known as Amman Civil Airport; code ADJ), 
a small airfield 5km east of Downtown, is served only by regional charters.

Queen Alia International Airport
Amman's main Queen Alia International Airport - code AMM, abbreviated locally to 
QAIA - is located on the edge of the desert, 35km south of Amman and about 18km 
east of Madaba. It is signposted off Jordan's main north-south highway, which is known 
in the south as the Desert Highway and around Amman as the Airport Road.
Between 2009 and 2012, the airport is undergoing major changes. A vast new 
terminal, designed by British architect Norman Foster, is being built alongside the 
existing buildings, which will be demolished following the handover to the new 
terminal in late 2011. Until then, expect a certain amount of disruption.
Before the new airport is open
The current airport has two terminals, occupying opposite halves of a single, 
H-shaped building. Terminal 1 (the South Terminal) is used mainly by Royal 
Jordanian, and Terminal 2 (the North Terminal) is used mainly by other carriers. To 
get from one to the other, simply cross the road - or, if you are already "air-side" (that 
is, upstairs), make your way through the Duty-Free Shop, which occupies the cross-
piece of the H. There are no left-luggage facilities.
Arrival
Almost all nationalities are routinely issued with a visa on arrival (details on p.65). At 
the visa desk, one ofﬁcial will take your passport and fee (10JD, in cash dinars only) 
and his colleague will stamp you in. Bank counters for changing money are alongside. 
You then proceed downstairs to ground level for baggage reclaim. Porter service is 
ofﬁcially free, but if you ask for help, a tip of 1JD is ﬁne, 2JD generous. Beside the 
reclaim carousels is a small duty-free shop. Your suitcases must be X-rayed and 
then you come through to the arrivals hall.
Airport taxis wait outside, and drivers will approach you. Fares to all destinations 
are ﬁxed: they are posted beside one of the exit doors. From the airport to Amman 
costs JD20-22 (depending on the district), to the Dead Sea JD34, to Petra JD77, to 
Aqaba JD111. Prices include baggage.
You can ignore claims that there are no buses: Airport Express buses leave from 
marked points outside both arrival halls to Tabarbour station, dropping off ﬁrst in 
Shmeisani (daily hourly 7am-11pm, then every 2hr overnight; takes 45min; driver's 
mobile T077 731 6000). The fare is JD3, including baggage.
Departure
A taxi from anywhere in Amman should cost around JD18-20; driving time is about 
45 minutes. Airport Express buses (info T06 489 1073) leave from Tabarbour 
station (daily hourly 6am-10pm, then every 2hr overnight; JD3 including baggage), 
picking up also from marked stops at Interior Circle in Shmeisani and 7th Circle. Ask 
your hotel to conﬁrm the schedule.
If you're ﬂying with Royal Jordanian, avoid the airport queues by using RJ's City
Terminal at 7th Circle (daily 7.30am-9.30pm; T06 585 6855). Here, you can check 
your bags in and receive a boarding card, anywhere between 24 hours and 3 hours 
in advance of your departure; using this facility gives you an extra baggage 
allowance of 10kg above the usual limit. You can then go back into the city or, if your 
ﬂight is imminent, take RJ's private bus direct to the airport (every 30min; JD3). You're 
led through a fast-track gate direct to passport control.
Airport hotel
The only hotel at the airport is the four-star Golden Tulip, previously known as the 
Alia (T06 445 1000, Wwww.goldentulip.com; 7), located about 1km along the link 
road between the airport and the highway. Facilities are adequate but it's rather 
soulless: most of its business comes from transit passengers.
AMMAN |

Some domestic shuttles to and from Aqaba formerly operated from here and 
may do so again in future. A taxi to Downtown costs about JD2.
By bus or serveece
Amman has numerous termini scattered all over the city for local and interna-
tional arrivals by bus or serveece (shared taxi). Where you end up depends 
partly on where you're coming from, and partly on what form of transport 
you're using.
Serveeces from Damascus arrive alongside a large parking area in the Abdali
district (pronounced AB-d'lee) - formerly a major bus station, now under 
redevelopment.
Scheduled JETT (and partner) buses from Aqaba, Damascus, Cairo and other 
cities terminate alongside the JETT offices, about 1km uphill from Abdali. 
Grab any taxi or serveece heading downhill to reach the Downtown hotels.
Tabarbour station (aka North station, mujemma ash-shamal), 5km north of 
Abdali, is the terminus for buses and serveeces from towns north of Amman - 
including Jerash, Ajloun, Irbid and Salt - as well as some from Madaba. Airport 
Express buses from Queen Alia airport, and serveeces from the King Hussein/
Allenby Bridge (for Jerusalem) also terminate here. Reckon on a taxi fare of 
about 3JD to reach the city-centre hotels.
Wihdat station (aka South station, mujemma al-janoob), 5km south of 
Downtown Amman near Middle East Circle, is where buses and serveeces from 
the south of Jordan arrive - chiefly Aqaba, Petra, Ma'an, Karak and some from 
Madaba - as well as a handful of international buses. It lies a 3-4JD taxi ride 
from any hotels. Serveeces run frequently between Wihdat and Tabarbour, and 
Wihdat and Raghadan, for less than JD0.50.
Muhajireen station, 2km southwest of Downtown, directly beneath the hill 
of 3rd Circle, is the arrival point for minibuses from west of Amman, including 
the Dead Sea, Wadi Seer, Shuneh al-Janubiyyeh and some from Madaba.
Raghadan station, in the heart of Downtown, at the time of writing 
hosted only serveeces serving neighbourhoods within Amman: the buses 
from here to nearby destinations such as Zarqa, Salt and Madaba had been 
shifted 2km east to the Mahatta station, pending an overhaul of transport 
services in the area.
Buses run by Trust International Transport from Aqaba, as well as from Tel 
Aviv and Nazareth, terminate outside the company's office at the corner of 
Saleh al-Smadi and Ibn al-Fata streets near the big Safeway supermarket by 7th 
Circle. A taxi ride to Downtown is about JD4.
By train
At the time of writing, no scheduled passenger trains were operating in Jordan: 
service on the historic Hejaz Railway line from Damascus had been suspended, 
reportedly permanently.
Information
Amman has no tourist information office. The Greater Amman Municipality 
(GAM) has an English website at Wwww.ammancity.gov.jo - but it's pretty thin. 
For printed brochures, contact the Jordan Tourism Board (JTB) in your home 
country before you depart; p.71 gives contacts and a list of websites offering 
AMMAN | Information

87
specialist information. Bookshops within five-star hotels stock good maps - 
invariably better than the free JTB handouts. For details about Jordan's nature 
reserves, and to book overnight stays, walks or meal-stops at any of them, drop 
into the Wild Jordan centre (see p.105).
City transport
Due to its geography and the unplanned nature of its expansion, Amman 
doesn't have an integrated transport system: buses and serveeces compete on 
set routes around the city (you'll never have to wait long beside a main road to 
flag one or other of them down), but none runs to a timetable. Few people pay 
heed to the roadside bus-stop pillars that appeared in some districts recently: 
most buses and all serveeces will stop anywhere. The fares quoted below are 
approximate.
Expect major changes over the next few years. A light railway is under 
construction between Amman and Zarqa, which may be extended to encompass 
a city-centre network. The mayor's office is also grappling with bringing order 
to the current, chaotic system of buses and serveeces: this may include transport 
maps, marked stops, published fares, and so on. Time will tell. In the meantime, 
make use of the Amman City Tour buses (see below): 10JD for their 24-hour 
pass is pretty good value.
Serveeces
Serveeces (shared taxis) are essential for getting quickly and easily up the hills 
surrounding Downtown, and for crossing between districts. They operate like 
small buses, with between four and six passengers cramming in and everyone 
paying a flat fare. You can get in or out wherever you like on the set route. All 
Amman's city serveeces are white cars, with black stencilled panels in Arabic on 
both front doors stating the general district they're going to. The cars tend to 
form long nose-to-tail lines at the bottom of the Downtown hills; the first 
passengers in the queue pile into the last car in line, which then pulls out and 
grinds its way past all the others up the hill and away. All the rest then roll 
backwards one place and the same thing happens again.
No official information or route maps exist: the only sure-fire way to find out 
which serveece goes where is to ask passers-by or local shopkeepers. If you want 
Heavy traffic
Trafﬁc in Amman - especially West Amman - can be horrendous. There's an 
estimated one car for every seven residents; with the population approaching two 
million, that makes for one almighty trafﬁc jam. Add to that an inﬂux during the 
summer of tens of thousands of visitors from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, almost all of 
whom drive their own cars, and the problem reaches crisis levels. All this isn't helped 
by the local driving style: lane discipline is nonexistent, cars are frequently parked (or 
double-parked) to block the ﬂow of trafﬁc, roundabouts are a free-for-all, poor trafﬁc-
light phasing often leads to gridlock, and so on. Many pinchpoints around the city 
experience all-day congestion (streets in the complex Downtown one-way system, 
and in and around Shmeisani, are often nose-to-tail), and you should allow up to an 
hour to cross the city during the day. Thursday afternoons - the start of the weekend 
getaway - are notoriously bad. Respite comes overnight, and on Fridays.
AMMAN | City transport

88
to pick up a serveece partway along its route, a bunch of people forming 
themselves into a queue on the kerbside is a sure sign of a stop. When you want 
to get out, saying "allah yaatik al-afyeh" ("God give you strength") will have the 
driver veering over to the kerb for you.
Fares are in the order of JD0.20-0.30 per person, except on long crosstown 
routes, which can be JD0.50 or more. Serveeces run frequently from 7am to 
about 7pm, after which time they tend to operate as unmetered taxis.
Taxis
Roughly a quarter of all cars in Amman are yellow taxis; the metered fares are 
relatively cheap and they can whisk you to places that might take hours to get 
to by any other means. Unless you're starting from a remote neighbourhood or 
are planning a journey in the middle of the night, you'll rarely have to wait long 
to be able to hail one. You should insist on the meter being switched on before 
you start moving, though practically all drivers will do it anyway as a matter of 
course. The meters always work; if a driver claims it's broken and tries to 
negotiate a fixed fare with you, simply say "ma'alesh" ("forget it") and wait for 
another taxi to come along. Although fares don't rise at night, the proportion 
of "broken" meters does.
At the time of writing, the flagfall starting rate was JD0.25, with JD0.10 added 
for every 58m of travel. A ten-minute ride should cost something like JD1.50-
1.80, with a crosstown journey JD4 or more. Don't misplace the decimal point: 
we've had reports of first-time visitors seeing "1600" on the meter, and handing 
over JD16 instead of JD1.60. Not every driver will point out the mistake.
Although most drivers know their way around pretty well, no Ammani relates 
to street names. Unless you're going somewhere obvious, like Wihdat station or 
the Roman Theatre, first give the name of the neighbourhood you're heading 
for, then, as you get closer, tell the driver which building you want, or maybe a 
nearby landmark: if he's not familiar with it, he'll quite likely just drive around 
asking passers-by for directions.
Walking in Amman
Walking in Amman is a mixed bag. It's absolutely the only way to get around 
Downtown, but once you venture further out, distances between sights lengthen and 
the uptown hills feel like mountain peaks.
You can walk from one end of Downtown to the other in about twenty or thirty 
minutes, staying on the ﬂat the whole way. Jebel al-Lweibdeh and the lower reaches 
of Jebel Amman (below 3rd Circle) are residential and can be explored on foot, but 
elsewhere, if you try to walk, you'll generally ﬁnd yourself slogging along streams of 
trafﬁc in neighbourhoods designed for driving.
However, one of the most delightful discoveries of old Amman - largely ignored by 
visitors and locals alike - are the ﬂights of steps which trace direct paths up and 
down the steep Downtown hills, dating from the days in the 1930s and 1940s when 
hillside residences were otherwise inaccessible. Countless ﬂights - many weed-
ridden and crumbling - crisscross the area below 1st Circle on Jebel Amman, the 
nose of Jebel al-Lweibdeh, the ﬂanks of Jebel al-Qal'a and the hills above the 
Roman Theatre, passing now and then through private backyards, beneath washing 
lines or past deserted, once-grand villas. If you're decently dressed and sensitive to 
the fact that you're tramping through people's gardens - as well as to the possibility 
that the steps you happen to have chosen might not go anywhere - you're basically 
free to explore.
AMMAN | City transport

89
A new fleet of silver-coloured luxury taxis was launched in 2009, with 
higher fares (flagfall around JD0.60), trained drivers and a central radio dispatch 
system. They are - uniquely - bookable by phone and online (T06 579 9999, 
Wwww.taxi-jo.com).
Buses
City buses compete with serveeces on popular routes around the city - but, 
with Arabic-only destination boards and no route maps, they are unlikely to be 
of much use to short-stay visitors.
More useful are the large air-conditioned coaches of the hop-on/hop-off 
Amman City Tour (Wwww.ammancitytour.com), which make a regular 
circuit daily between 10am and 8pm (6pm in winter), stopping at 45 marked 
points from the Roman Theatre and Jebel al-Qal'a right out to Shmeisani, the 
King Hussein Park, Mecca Mall, Sweifiyyeh, Abdoun, Rainbow Street and back 
to Downtown: the website has a detailed map. A full circuit takes about two 
hours, with the gap between buses about 40 minutes. A tourist pass, valid for 
unlimited rides in 24 hours, is JD10 - buyable on board and from some hotels.
Accommodation
Amman has accommodation to suit all budgets. Hoteliers city-wide are tuned 
into the needs and expectations of Western tourists, but outside the luxury end 
of the market, you'll find that their margins are tight: standards are sometimes 
make-do, although the welcome extended to guests is invariably warm. 
Inexpensive options are in Downtown. The best mid-range hotels are a bit 
further out, on Jebel Amman, while luxury hotels are spread throughout the 
city's upscale districts.
With Amman's unusual appeal - focused much more on atmosphere and 
gentle exploration rather than on a specific set of must-see attractions - there's 
an odd division to staying here. All the antiquities are in Downtown, but all the 
decent hotels (above budget levels) are several kilometres away in West Amman. 
It takes a shift in attitude to appreciate the value of this: the cafés and streetlife 
outside your hotel in, say, Shmeisani are just as much an Amman "attraction" as 
the Roman antiquities far away in Downtown.
In the high season (March-Oct), many places across all price brackets fill up 
quickly, and you'd be well advised to book ahead, even for the cheapest of the 
cheap. There are no campsites in or near Amman.
Inexpensive hotels
At first glance, Downtown Amman seems crammed with inexpensive hotels, 
lining all the main streets, but most of them should be avoided: they are either 
grimly unappealing dives - tape holding the windows together, unchanged 
beds, thick dust and ancient bathrooms - or simply labourers' dosshouses. 
Female travellers may not feel safe at many of these places. Hostel-booking 
websites don't help, falsely publicizing many distinctly shabby establishments as 
backpacker-friendly.
Despite this, there are some good-value inexpensive hotels out there. Key 
attributes aside from cleanliness are some form of air cooling in summer - 
whether a ceiling fan or air conditioning (a table fan won't do) - and heating in 
winter. Rooms on higher floors tend to be less prone to dust and traffic noise.

The places listed below are marked on the map on p.90. Hotels reviewed in 
this book are safe for all.
Downtown
Bdeiwi Omar al-Khayyam St T06 464 3394. A 
friendly, good-quality budget hotel, on a relatively 
quiet street up the hill behind the post ofﬁce, with 
clean, spartan rooms (with fans) and reliable hot 
water. 1
Cliff Opposite Hashem's restaurant in an alley 
between Prince Muhammad and Basman sts T06
462 4273. Once Jordan's leading backpacker hotel, 
the Cliff has nowadays been superseded. The 
welcome is as warm as ever, but tired decor, lumpy 
beds and noise from the next-door restaurant can 
let it down. Rooms are clean, but have only cold-
water sinks and fans (with no heaters). Hot 
showers cost JD0.50. Other features include free 
luggage storage and use of the kitchen, plus 
transport around Jordan. 1
Farah Off Cinema al-Hussein St T06 465 
1443, Wwww.farahhotel.com.jo. Dynamic, 
ambitiously run budget hotel on six ﬂoors, up an 
alley behind the cinema, with a lift, nice decor and 
a pleasant front garden. Out of 24 rooms, ﬁve are 
en suite, with a/c, heating and hot water; for the 
remainder, every three rooms share two 
bathrooms (with time-restricted hot water). Dorms, 
of various sizes, are available. Staff are friendly 
and attuned to backpacker needs: expect cut-price 
transport around Jordan, deals on airport runs, and 
so on. 1-2
Palace King Faysal St T06 462 4326, Wwww
.palacehotel.com.jo. Take the lift up to an 
unexpectedly good backpacker-style hotel above 
the main drag, more or less opposite the Gold 
Souk. Staff are friendly, offering cut-price transport 
around the country, and the rooms are well turned 
out, including cheaper options with shared 
bathrooms. The top-ﬂoor rooms stand out: for its 
a/c, en-suite bathroom and two connecting 
balconies wrapping around the side of the 
building, with rooftop views, room 404 (a twin) is 
the best in Downtown Amman. Book for a 
discounted airport pick-up/drop-off. 1-2
Sydney 9th of Shaaban St T06 464 1122. Basic but 
adequate budget hotel, located a short walk away 
from the Downtown bustle, at the beginning of the 
hill climbing to 1st Circle. Rooms are clean enough 
and comfortable, even though the public areas are a 
bit tired and hot water can be sporadic. 1
Mid-range hotels
Most mid-range options are located in the hills above Downtown - small, 
comfortable hotels, ranging from the straightforward to the elegant, but often 
in residential or commercial districts, a long way from sights and attractions: 
relying on taxis is pretty much essential. Many, however, offer a gentle ambience 
and a quality of service that's hard to find elsewhere.
All these places are marked on the maps on p.90, p.93 or p.95.
Downtown
Amman Palace Quraysh St ("Saqf Sayl") T06
464 6172. Pitched at a respectable Arab clientele, 
this is the best hotel in Downtown Amman (which 
isn't saying much), rated as two stars. Its seventy 
rooms are plain and clean, all en suite and with a/c 
and heating. Although it's on a main trafﬁc street, 
upper-ﬂoor rooms are quiet. An unusual choice, 
with atmosphere - and the location, in the middle 
of the souk, is unique. Not to be confused with the 
Palace Hotel (see above). 3
Abdali & around
Canary Opposite Terra Sancta College, Jebel al-
Lweibdeh T06 463 8353, Ecanary_h@hotmail
.com. Peaceful two-star family hotel that gets much 
of its business from Western tour groups, where 21 
clean, comfortable doubles come with TV, fan and 
breakfast - and prices for individuals are negotiable. 
A perfect escape from the Downtown crush. 2-3
Caravan Police College Rd near King 
Abdullah Mosque, Jebel al-Lweibdeh T06
566 1195, Ecaravan@go.com.jo. A comfortable, 
characterful old hotel with a solid reputation to 
uphold. The 27 rooms are clean and pleasant, all 
with fan and some with balcony - and the location, 
very near the former Abdali bus station, is handy. 
Book well in advance. 2-3
Toledo King Hussein St T06 465 7777, Wwww
.toledohotel.jo. Tolerable three-star hotel in a 
convenient location, backing onto the former Abdali 
bus station but also built into the side of the 
mountainous hill of Jebel Hussein. From street level 
on the Abdali side, take the lift up to the 7th ﬂoor 
for the Moorish-style lobby and main street 
entrance (from Jebel Hussein's Al-Razi St). Older

rooms, though decently furnished, are a bit tired, 
and bathrooms decidedly poky; the hotel is 
expanding, though, and new rooms may be ready 
by the time you visit. Non-smoking available. 3
Jebel Amman
Bonita Inn Opposite InterContinental hotel, near 
3rd Circle T06 461 5061, Wwww.bonitaamman
.com. More like a cheerful guesthouse than a hotel: 
its six rooms, located above a good Spanish restau-
rant and tapas bar, are often booked up weeks 
ahead. Staff are friendly and approachable; the 
rooms, though modest in size and rather 80s in 
decor, are decent, comfortable, clean and cosy, with 
en-suite bathrooms and a/c. A great choice. 4
Dove Qurtubah St, between 4th and 5th Circles 
T06 569 7601. A small, ex-Best Western two-star 
hotel located in a far-ﬂung residential district, with 
cool breezes and nice views. Unremarkable rooms 
are spacious, some with balconies; prices will 
halve with a little encouragement. 3
Hisham Off Mithqal al-Fayez St near the French 
Embassy, between 3rd and 4th Circles T06 464 
4028, Wwww.hishamhotel.com.jo. Small, long-
established residential hotel in the embassy 
quarter with an excellent reputation and 
unfailingly courteous and efﬁcient staff. A 
peaceful terrace, pub, good food and plenty of 
personal touches make this one of the best 
family hotels in Jordan. 5-6
San Rock International Behind Crowne Plaza 
Hotel, off 6th Circle T06 551 3800, Wwww
.sanrock-hotel.com. A ﬁne mid-range tourist hotel 
- one of the best in the city - with spacious, 
comfortable rooms, good facilities (a/c, spotless 
bathrooms) and prompt, efﬁcient service. It's 
located on a quiet backstreet near the shops and 
restaurants of Umm Uthayna and Sweiﬁyyeh, a 
long way out of the centre. 6
Shepherd Zaid bin al-Harith St, a backstreet 
midway between 1st and 2nd Circles T06 463 
9197, Wwww.shepherd-hotel.com. An excellent 
choice with a touch of class, comfortably close to 
both the Downtown sights and the uptown restau-
rants. Rooms are pleasant and quiet (with a/c), 
service is calm and the breakfast is good. Its 
reputation and consistently good standards bring in 
plenty of repeat business from tourists and 
businesspeople alike. 4-5
Shmeisani
Al-Qasr Metropole Arroub St T06 568 9671, 
Wwww.alqasrmetropole.com. Quality upper-mid-
range hotel on a quiet residential street behind 
Shmeisani. Cosy rooms are very light and bright, 
with all the facilities - go for those on the upper 
ﬂoors, which have balconies and spectacular city 
views. One of the top choices for business people 
bored with ﬁve-star isolation. Also with an excellent 
penthouse bar and restaurants. 6-7
Luxury hotels
Amman boasts a full complement of international-grade luxury hotels, almost 
all of them managed by one or other of the global hotel groups. Booking direct 
online nabs the most competitive rates, though if you're prepared to chance it 
and walk in off the street without a booking, you might find that a gentle bit 
of bargaining could secure you a discounted corporate rate at substantially less 
than the walk-in "rack rate". All these offer no-smoking rooms on request 
- most have no-smoking floors - and all are marked on the maps on p.82, p.93 
or p.95.
Jebel Amman
Crowne Plaza 6th Circle T06 551 0001, 
Wwww.cpamman.com. Not a pretty building, 
and now dwarfed by the giant Jordan Gate twin 
towers directly behind, but nonetheless an 
excellent ﬁve-star hotel, newly upgraded in 
2009. Rooms are comfortable and service is 
outstanding. This is a great choice for a ﬁrst 
night in the city if you're driving in from the 
airport - turn off the Airport Highway at 7th 
Circle, just nearby - and the hotel stands 
within walking distance of the shops and 
restaurants of both Swayﬁyyeh and Umm 
Uthaina. 9
Four Seasons 5th Circle T06 550 5555, Wwww
.fourseasons.com/amman. Probably the grandest 
hotel in the city, perhaps the country - a palatial, 
ﬁfteen-storey landmark. Rooms are the largest in 
Amman - exceptionally well appointed, with every 
detail taken care of. The public areas are stunningly 
opulent, and there's a large spa and a clutch of top 
restaurants and bars. You could want for nothing 
more. 9
Grand Hyatt 3rd Circle T06 465 1234, Wwww
.amman.hyatt.com. Superbly designed hotel on 
the main road between 3rd Circle and Shmeisani, 
replete with every international business facility 
along with a giant ﬁtness centre with indoor and

Downtown
Although you shouldn't leave Amman without having spent at least some time 
in Downtown, the cramped valleys between towering hills shelter compara-
tively few obvious sights. Rather, Downtown is the spiritual and physical heart 
of the city and is unmissable for its streetlife. This is the district that most strongly 
resembles the stereotype of a Middle Eastern city - loud with traffic and voices, 
Arabic music blaring from shopfronts, people selling clothes, coffee, cigarettes or 
trinkets on the street. The handful of Roman ruins that survive here have been 
irreverently incorporated into the everyday bustle of the city: the banked seating 
of the huge Roman Theatre is always dotted with small groups of locals 
seeking refuge from the traffic noise, and the adjacent forum is filled with trees 
and cafés, a public meeting place today as it was two millennia ago.
The Roman forum
The Roman forum, dominating the heart of Downtown, is the best place to 
begin. The massive theatre was the centrepiece of Roman Philadelphia, and also 
the initial focus for Amman's modern settlement late in the nineteenth century.
outdoor pools, several excellent restaurants, 
nightclub and supremely comfortable guest 
rooms. 9
InterContinental 2nd Circle T06 464 1361, 
Wwww.interconti.com/amman. One of the city's 
landmarks, and the standard choice for visiting 
journalists, diplomats and CEOs; taxi-drivers often 
call it by its old name of Funduq al-Urdun (Jordan
Hotel), harking back to the days when it was the 
only luxury hotel in the country. Now completely 
renovated and extended, it has modern, spacious, 
well-appointed rooms and is packed with all kinds 
of diversions, from a crafts gallery to live music.

prefer ﬁve-star character to mere opulence. 9
There is a map of Downtown Amman on p.90.
AMMAN | Downtown

97
As you approach from the main Hashmi Street, winding your way through 
the trees, an impressively long Corinthian colonnade and some original 
Roman paving are the only physical remains of Philadelphia's forum, the 
marketplace which filled the gap between the theatre and the street. What also 
survives, however, is the spirit of the place: this whole area is still Downtown's 
main hangout, as Ammanis crowd the little cafés, promenade up and down in 
the dappled sunshine, guzzle ice cream and sweets, meet friends and snooze 
on the grass.
Several nineteenth-century travellers to Amman reported seeing the remains 
of a large propylaeum, or ornamental gateway, on the edge of the forum; this 
still stood in 1911 but has since disappeared. If you stop in front of the Theatre 
and look back towards the street, high on the summit of Jebel al-Qal'a opposite 
you'll spot the columns of the Temple of Hercules; originally, the propylaeum 
stood here at what was the foot of a tremendous monumental staircase leading 
down from the temple, linking the religious and social quarters of the city.
The Roman Theatre
Cut into a depression in the hillside, the Roman Theatre (Sat-Thurs roughly 
8am-sunset, Fri 10am-4pm; JD1) is impressively huge, and the view, as well as 
the ability to eavesdrop on conversations between ant-like people on the stage 
below, definitely repays the steep climb to the top. The structure was built 
between 169 and 177 AD, during the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, for an 
audience of almost six thousand, and is still occasionally filled today for concerts. 
Above the seating is a small, empty shrine with niches; the dedication isn't 
known, although part of a statue of Athena was discovered during clearance 
work. Standing on the stage or in the orchestra - the semicircle in front of the 
stage - you can get a sense of the ingenuity of the theatre's design: the south-
facing stage is flooded with sun throughout the day, while virtually every 
spectator remains undazzled and in cool shadow. To discover the incredible 
acoustics, stand in the middle of the orchestra and declaim at the seating, and 
your normal speaking voice will suddenly gain a penetrating echo; step off that 
spot and there's no echo. Furthermore, two people crouching down at opposite 
ends of the orchestra can mutter into the semicircular stone wall below the first 
row of seats and easily hear each other.
To the sides of the stage are two small museums, housed in vaults beneath the 
auditorium. On the right as you walk in, the Folklore Museum (same hours & 
ticket) displays mannequins engaged in traditional crafts and a moderately inter-
esting reconstruction of an old-fashioned living-room. More worthwhile is the 
Jordanian Museum of Popular Traditions, opposite (same hours & ticket), 
which enlivens the well-worn theme of traditional clothing, jewellery and 
customs by rooting it firmly in the present-day life of ordinary people. The 
Renovating Downtown
The government and municipality have settled on a new master plan for Amman 
(Wwww.ammanplan.gov.jo), including a revamp of the Downtown area. The Ras al-Ain 
district, at the western end of Talal Street, has been transformed by the construction 
of a new City Hall, the Al-Hussein Cultural Centre and the Jordan Museum. Next in 
line is what has been dubbed "Wadi Amman" - principally the area around the Roman 
Theatre. This is set to host one (possibly two) new hotels, shops, a public library and 
new transport links - including, potentially, a funicular railway running up to the citadel. 
By the time you visit, you may ﬁnd renovations in full swing.
AMMAN | Downtown

vaulted rooms are full of examples of national dress, with detailed notes and 
occasional photographs to set them in context. Other exhibits include pieces of 
antique bedouin jewellery and a fascinating range of stones used in healing, as well 
as mosaics downstairs gathered from Madaba and Jerash (and viewable up close).
The Odeon
Facing onto the forum area outside the theatre is the Roman Odeon (closes 
1hr earlier; same ticket). This renovated freestanding theatre, seating about five 
hundred, dates from slightly earlier than its bigger neighbour and was probably 
the venue for either parliamentary-style council meetings or small-scale drama. 
In antiquity, the whole building would probably have been roofed. Amman's 
grand old Philadelphia Hotel, the country's first (and, for many decades, only) 
hotel, was built in the 1920s beside the Odeon on the banks of the Sayl Amman, 
which was then a stream flowing through the city centre; sadly, the hotel was 
demolished in the 1980s to make way for Downtown redevelopment - which 
then never really took off.
The Husseini Mosque and around
From the Roman Theatre, lively Hashmi Street storms west past shawerma 
stands, juice bars, patisseries and cafés towards the commercial hub of 
Downtown and the focal, pink-and-white-striped Husseini Mosque. Like 
everything else in Amman, this is a relatively recent construction, although a 
mosque has stood here since 640 (and, before that, a Byzantine cathedral). 
However, any remnant of the original building was erased when Emir Abdullah 
ordered the site cleared for construction of the current mosque in 1932. It 
remains one of Amman's most important places of worship, and is often also the 
focus for political demonstrations. You're free to wander inside, as long as you 
are dressed suitably decently.
The building on the corner opposite the mosque formerly held Amman's 
best-loved coffee house, the grand old Arab League Café - a stalwart here for 
 Roman theatre, Downtown Amman

over fifty years, with its fine balcony overlooking the bustle below. In 2002, after 
a wrangle between the building's owners (one wanted to keep it as it was; the 
other wanted to rebuild), the café was closed by court order and - to the horror 
of seemingly everyone in the city bar the owners themselves - gutted. In a city 
which already lacks history, a piece of the past has been lost.
The area around the mosque remains the heart of Amman's bazaars. To the 
east lies a bustling warren of alleys known as the Souk Sukkr (Sugar Market), 
where stalls sell everything from dates and spices to soap and mops. To the west 
of the mosque, the main street funnelling traffic out of Downtown is King
Talal Street, lined with stores selling ordinary household goods, fabric and 
bric-a-brac; a little way down on the left, hidden behind a row of shopfronts, is 
the city's main fruit and vegetable market.
The main street parallel to King Talal Street follows exactly the course of the 
Roman decumanus maximus, which was formed by paving over the free-flowing 
stream beneath. The street - officially Quraysh Street - is still popularly known 
as the Saqf Sayl (Roof of the Stream), but these days the sayl is dry, having been 
tapped much further upstream to provide drinking water. This is the busiest and 
liveliest area of the city, with cobblers, CD stalls and hawkers of soap and tooth-
brushes competing for space under the pavement colonnades with a dirt-cheap 
secondhand clothes market. There's also a small bus station here serving villages 
near Amman.
The Nymphaeum
On the Saqf Sayl behind the Husseini Mosque, excavation and restoration work 
on the Roman Nymphaeum has been going on for years, seemingly without 
end. It's very similar in design to the huge nymphaeum at Jerash, which has been 
dated to 191 AD; at that time, Philadelphia too was at its zenith. The site is fenced 
and is usually off-limits, though the guardian may not object to you exploring. 
However, apart from the immensity of the building (and its newer reconstruction), 
there's not an awful lot to admire. Nymphaea - public fountains dedicated to water 
nymphs - were sited near rivers running through major cities throughout the 
Greco-Roman world. This one, facing onto an open plaza at the junction of the 
two principal city streets, the east-west decumanus and the north-south cardo, was 
originally two storeys high and must have been quite a sight, dominating the area. 
Colonnades of Corinthian columns would have drawn even more attention 
towards the concave building, which was lavishly faced in marble, with statues of 
gods, emperors or city notables filling the niches all around.
King Faysal Street
The Husseini Mosque faces up King Faysal Street (also known as Faysal 
Square), modern Amman's oldest thoroughfare, occupying the valley between 
Jebel Amman to the south and Jebel al-Qal'a to the north. Although it follows 
exactly the course of the Roman cardo, any trace of the ancient past has been 
built over: the oldest buildings, with elegant arched windows and decorated 
stone balconies, date only from the 1920s. One of the nicest, at no. 12 (beside 
the Arab Bank), is open to visitors - known as the "Duke's Diwan" (Sat-Thurs 
roughly 8am-sunset; free). This building, which dates from 1924, formerly 
served as the main post office, an annexe of the Ministry of Finance and, from 
the 1950s, as the Haifa Hotel (whose sign still lies in one of the rooms). In the 
last few years it has been renovated as a labour of love by a prominent Jordanian 
businessman, Mamdouh Bisharat, who owns land in the village of Mukhaybeh 
(see p.179) and is known as the "Duke of Mukhaybeh" - hence "Duke's Diwan" 
AMMAN | Downtown

(a diwan is a place for meetings and gatherings). The entrance gives onto a long 
flight of steps. At the top is an atmospheric suite of seven rooms around a central 
hallway, decorated with old photos of Amman, paintings and cabinets of bric-a-
brac. Students, artists and Ammani old-timers often gather here, to compare 
notes and chew the fat. Roam around as you like; you'll inevitably be invited 
by the caretaker to drink tea on the balcony. The diwan also hosts occasional 
informal concerts and artistic events.
Opposite, another fine old building known as Al-Rasheed Courts has been 
converted into the Eco-Tourism Café - a bizarre, misleading name for a 
perfectly ordinary locals' coffee house: indulging in a tea and an argileh on their 
balcony, hanging over the street, is a great way to absorb the Downtown 
atmosphere.
Alongside the diwan - aside from the wonderful pastry shop Habiba, 
renowned for its delicious kunafeh (see p.46) - is the Gold Souk, a series of tiny 
jewellery shops clustered together in a little network of alleys; see p.119 for 
more about buying gold. Nearby is Shabsough Street, named after the 
The Circassians
The ﬁrst people to settle in Amman in modern times were Muslim refugees from 
Christian persecution in Russia. The Circassians, who began arriving in the 1870s, 
trace their origins back to mountain villages above the eastern Black Sea, in the 
region of the Caucasus around present-day Georgia and Chechnya.
In the 1860s, Russian military offensives in the Caucasus forced 1.5 million people 
out of their homes into exile in Ottoman Turkish territory. Some headed west towards 
the fertile lands of the Balkans (establishing Muslim communities in and around 
Bosnia), while others drifted south into the Ottoman province of Syria. Stories began 
to ﬁlter back to those left behind of life in a Muslim land, and many Circassian and 
Chechen villages went en masse into voluntary exile. European governments lent 
their weight to the Ottoman policy of dumping the refugees on ships bound for 
distant Syria.
Meanwhile, Amman had been uninhabited for virtually a thousand years. In 1877, 
Selah Merrill, a visiting American archeologist, "spent part of one night in the great 
theatre... The sense of desolation was oppressive. Kings, princes, wealth and beauty 
once came here to be entertained, where now I see only piles of stones, owls and 
bats, wretched fellahin [peasants] and donkeys, goats and ﬁlth." The ﬁrst Circassian 
refugees arrived the following year, setting up home in the galleries of the theatre; 
others founded new villages in the fertile valley of Wadi Seer to the west and among 
the deserted ruins of Jerash to the north. The presence of settlers caused some 
conﬂict with local tribes, but the Circassians held their own in skirmishes with the 
bedu, and soon a mutual respect and a formal pact of friendship emerged between 
them. After 1900, Circassian labour was central to the building of the Hejaz railway 
line, and Circassian farmers became famed for their industry. One of their great 
innovations was the reintroduction of the wheel: with no roads to speak of, wheeled 
transport hadn't been used in Transjordan for centuries.
When, in the 1920s, Emir Abdullah established a new state and chose Amman to 
be its capital, he bound the Circassian community into his new administration: loyal 
and well-educated families were the mainstay of both the ofﬁcer corps and the civil 
service. Over the years, however, overt expressions of Circassian culture faded: 
Arabic became the lingua franca, the use of national dress died out and, with the rise 
in land prices following the inﬂux of Palestinian refugees in 1948, many Circassians 
sold their inherited farmlands around Amman for the building of new suburbs. 
However, their internal identity remained strong, and Circassians today form an 
integrated minority of around 25,000.

rise up to Jebel al-Qal'a.
Faysal Street is another area slated for renovation: when you visit, you may find 
billboards removed, old buildings restored, new cafés installed, and so on. The most 
far-reaching proposal for change - redirecting traffic and pedestrianizing the street 
- was unfortunately scotched early on in the planning process, but there is little 
doubt, nonetheless, that the street could do with a wash-and-brush-up.
The Jordan Museum
Southwest of the Husseini Mosque, King Talal Street and the Saqf Sayl meet at 
a large traffic intersection. To the south rises the hill of Ashrafiyyeh (see p.109), 
while dead ahead (west), in the valley of the Sayl Amman, is an area known as 
Ras al-Ain (Source of the Spring). Here, just past a delightful open colonnaded 
plaza featuring a fountain at its centre, stands the large, new Jordan Museum, 
opened in late 2009. This sleek building houses the national archeological collec-
tion, as well as exhibits on Jordan's history and the story of the Hashemite royal 
family; the exact layout, though, had not been finalized as this book went to 
press. Expect halls to be designed thematically, with interactive displays and a 
strong educational angle. Partnerships established with institutions including the 
Louvre, the Smithsonian and museums in London, Switzerland and elsewhere 
are likely to ensure world-class temporary shows. Check the website Wwww
.jordanmuseum.jo for the latest details, including opening hours and prices.
Just nearby to the west stands the Al-Hussein Cultural Centre and Amman's 
City Hall. Both were co-designed by one of the Arab world's leading architects, 
Jafar Touqan, and both are light, airy and dynamic, often hosting exhibitions of 
contemporary art and free concerts, bringing affluent West Ammanis into a 
Downtown neighbourhood they might otherwise never visit. This regeneration 
of what was formerly a traffic island of dusty wasteground in a low-income 
neighbourhood is one of Amman's recent success stories - and it looks set to 
continue, with proposals to convert the site of an old cigarette factory near City 
Hall into the "Darat King Abdullah II", a theatre and concert venue to serve as 
a home for the Amman Symphony Orchestra. Discussions are continuing.
Jebel al-Qal'a
Jebel al-Qal'a (Citadel Hill) has been a focus for human settlement since the 
Paleolithic Age, more than 18,000 years ago. Unfortunately, when the Romans 
moved in to occupy the area, they cleared away whatever they found, including 
the remains of the Ammonite city of Rabbath Ammon, and chucked it over the 
side of the hill: Bronze Age, Iron Age and Hellenistic pottery shards have been 
found mixed up with Roman remains on the slopes below. Of the remains 
surviving today, the most impressive by far is a huge Umayyad palace complex
on the upper terrace of the Citadel, dating from the first half of the eighth 
century. On the middle terrace below and to the south lies the Roman Temple 
of Hercules, its massive columns dramatically silhouetted against the sky. East 
of the temple, Roman fortifications protect the grassy lower terrace, which has 
no visible antiquities.
The easiest way to reach the summit is by taxi (JD1 from Downtown). For 
the ambitious who prefer to walk, the twenty-minute ascent is extremely steep. 
About 150m along Shabsough Street as you head east, and just past the second 
turning on the left, a side-street has a wide flight of steps leading left up the 
AMMAN | Jebel al-Qal'a

102
hillside. Turn right at the top, and head up any way you can from here: there are 
crumbling steps most of the way, often leading through private backyards. You'll 
eventually arrive at the wall below the Temple of Hercules. If you're driving, 
head east out of Downtown towards Zarqa, come off, pass under the highway, 
and rejoin it heading west. Look hard to spot the brown sign for the Jebel al-
Qal'a antiquities pointing right; exit here, and at the traffic lights bear left 
steeply up the hill, along King Ali bin al-Hussein Street. Three-quarters of the 
way up is a hairpin left turn, which brings you to the ticket office.
Admission to the whole hilltop site (Sat-Thurs 8am-7pm, winter closes 4pm, 
Fri 10am-4pm) was formerly JD2, but you may find that has changed when you 
visit: the museum here, which formerly held the national archeological collection, 
changed status in 2009.
The Temple of Hercules
The Temple of Hercules, with its towering columns that are visible from 
Downtown, was built in the same period as the Roman Theatre below. The 
temple stands on a platform at the head of the monumental staircase which 
formerly led up from the lower city: the blocks on the cliff edge mark the 
position of the staircase, and afford a tremendous panoramic view over the city 
centre that is particularly striking at sunset, when - in addition to the visual 
dramatics - the dozens of mosques in the city all around start broadcasting the 
call to prayer almost simultaneously.
There is work under way here to consolidate the hillside, and the master plan 
for redevelopment of Amman city centre (see p.97) involves re-establishing the 
ancient link between the hilltop and valley floor - by means of stairways or, 
possibly, a funicular railway. This may mean works are ongoing.
The columns, which were re-erected in 1993, formed part of a colonnaded 
entrance to the cella, or inner sanctum. Within the cella - these days often the 
scene of hard-fought football games among the local kids - a patch of bare rock 
is exposed, which, it's thought, may have been the sacred rock that formed the 
centrepiece of the ninth-century BC Ammonite Temple of Milcom on this 
spot. The Roman dedication to Hercules is not entirely certain but, given the 
quantity of coins bearing his likeness found in the city below, pretty likely.
The Umayyad Palace
Climbing the path to the upper terrace from the Temple of Hercules, you'll pass 
a small ruined Byzantine church on the right, dating from the fifth or sixth 
centuries, which reused many of the columns from the nearby temple. The 
church formed part of a Byzantine town which probably covered much of the 
hill and which is still being excavated. About 20m further north are a huge 
round cistern and the remains of an olive-pressing works.
The huge Umayyad Palace complex stretches over the northern part of the 
hill. Part of the palace was built over pre-existing Roman structures, and an entire 
A new museum?
Opposite the Temple of Hercules stands what was formerly the National Archeolog-
ical Museum. In 2009 the national collection was moved to the Jordan Museum at 
Ras al-Ain (see p.101), making way for what was proposed, at the time of writing, to 
be a new museum devoted to the history of Amman. No details were available as this 
book went to press.
AMMAN | Jebel al-Qal'a

colonnaded Roman street was incorporated into it. Built after 720, when Amman 
was a provincial capital, the complex probably combined the residential quarters of 
the governor of Amman with administrative offices. It was still in use during the 
Islamic Abbasid (750-969) and Fatimid (969-1179) periods, although much of the 
brand-new palace was never rebuilt following a devastating earthquake in 749.
The first building you come to, and the most impressive, is the domed 
entrance hall, reached by crossing the first of four plazas. Built over an earlier 
Byzantine building (which is why it's in the shape of a cross), the hall is 
decorated with stucco colonnettes and Persian-style geometric patterns, set off 
by foliage rosettes and a houndstooth zigzag. Much renovation has been carried 
out here in recent years, not all of it subtly - the new stucco around the interior 
walls deliberately clashes with the original work, and in 1998 a new dome was 
hastily constructed above the building, riding roughshod over considerable 
archeological controversy about whether there ever was a dome here in 
antiquity. Between the entrance hall and the cistern is a small baths, although 
only a changing area and the "cold room" survive.
Beyond the entrance hall is the second large plaza, from which the colon-
naded street leads ahead. This was the heart of the administrative quarter, 
surrounded by nine separate office or residential buildings (of which only four 
have been excavated), each in the typical Umayyad style of a self-contained 
bayt - small rooms looking onto a central courtyard. The bayts were constructed 
within the pre-existing Roman enclosure, possibly a temple, whose exterior 
walls are still visible in places. To the west of the courtyard is "Building F", 
which may have been the site of official audiences, since it was of elegant 
design and situated close to the entrance hall; two large iwans - audience rooms 
open on one side - with triple arcades give onto a central courtyard, from 
where a staircase led to an upper storey.
At the far end of the colonnaded street, a decorated doorway takes you through 
the Roman wall into the third plaza and the private residential quarters of 
the ruler of Amman. Rooms open from three sides, but the plaza is dominated 
by a huge iwan, which presages a domed, cruciform throne room, or diwan. 
According to Umayyad protocol, the ruler always stayed hidden behind a curtain 
during audiences - the tiny passageway between the iwan and the diwan could 
have served this purpose. To either side lie the largely unexcavated residential 
bayts for the ruling household. At the back of the diwan, a doorway leads through 
to the fourth and final plaza - a private affair, looking north over the massive 
Roman retaining wall to the hills opposite.
West Amman
Of the other quarters of the city, you're most likely to visit sprawling, relatively 
wealthy West Amman, home to practically all of the city's upmarket hotels, as 
well as restaurants and nightlife. Key areas to explore include Jebel al-Lweibdeh, 
an attractive residential neighbourhood that is home to the National Gallery, 
and the lower reaches of Jebel Amman, particularly around 1st Circle, where 
the cafés and quirky shops of Rainbow Street make for some of the city's most 
pleasant strolling.
Jebel Amman: around 1st Circle
In general, West Amman is too large to attempt aimless exploratory rambling, 
though if you have a spare afternoon to fill, you might like to take a wander 
AMMAN | West Amman

104
through the leafy streets around 1st Circle on Jebel Amman. When Amman 
was a small town occupying the Downtown valley-floors, this gentle neigh-
bourhood was the preserve of the elite, including royalty, families wealthy 
through business or commerce, politicians and ambassadors, British commanders 
of the army, and so on. The quiet streets either side of Rainbow Street are still 
lined with many fine old villas dating from the 1920s and 1930s, remnants of 
this time, most of them freestanding one- or two-storey buildings surrounded 
by walled gardens.
Along Rainbow Street
As you head east from 1st Circle, Rainbow Street - named after the Rainbow 
Cinema on the right - is lined with shops, cafés and boutiques preceding the 
walled and gated British Council. Beyond here, the street dips sharply; partway 
along on the left is a mosque with a fine old minaret, while an anonymous-
looking town house on a minor street to the right, with a dark shade of plaster 
and curved Art Deco-style balcony railings, was where King Talal lived for a 
time before his accession, and where both the late King Hussein and his brother 
Prince Hassan were born.
Two of the most attractive villas in the area, both well signposted, are beside 
each other just off Rainbow Street about 250m east of the British Council. On 
the corner is an elegant symmetrical villa set back from the street and faced in 
local stone, with a stepped portico and tall, slender windows, that's now used as 
showrooms for the crafts of Jordan River Designs and Bani Hamida (see 
p.119). Alongside it is a one-storey villa - once home to Major Alec Kirkbride, 
the first British Ambassador to Jordan - with a beautiful portico of pointed 
arches, wrought-iron window-bars, and a lovely garden centred on a star-shaped 
fountain. Both these houses were built in the late 1920s by Salim al-Odat, an 
architect originally from Karak. Just round the corner with Asfour Street is a 
pair of houses built for Egyptian businessman and adviser to Emir Abdullah 
Ismail Bilbaysi, a smaller one dating from the 1930s with a semicircular 
balcony featuring a lavishly painted ceiling visible from the street, and beside it 
a much larger villa designed in the 1940s in a consciously medieval Mamluke 
style, with bands of alternating pink and white stone and pointed arches.
There is a map of Jebel Amman on p.93.
Amman's hammam
Hammams (Turkish baths) are common in Cairo, Damascus and many other Middle 
Eastern and North African cities, elegant and civilized places to steam the city dust 
out of your pores - but Amman is an exception: its short recent history means that it 
doesn't share the centuries-old urban traditions of its neighbours. There is, for all 
intents and purposes, only one hammam in the city, the modern Al-Pasha Turkish 
Bath (daily 10am-midnight; T06 463 3002, Wwww.pashaturkishbath.com), located 
on Mahmoud Taha Street, opposite the Ahlia girls' school; coming from 1st Circle 
along Rainbow Street, it's the ﬁfth street on the right. It is beautifully designed in tradi-
tional style and offers two hours of soaking, scrubbing, lathering and olive-oil 
massaging with professional male or female therapists for JD25. There are men-only 
hours, women-only hours and you can book ahead as a mixed group or a couple; call 
for details. Afterwards, don't miss out on herbal tea and/or a light meal of mezze in the 
beautiful garden courtyard - there are few more pleasant retreats in the city centre.
AMMAN | West Amman

105
Continuing past more cafés and crafts outlets down Rainbow Street, you come 
to the distinctively modernistic Mango House on the right, at the corner with 
Omar bin al-Khattab Street (aka Mango St). In smooth, reddish stone with 
curving, pillared balconies, it was built in the late 1940s by Kamal and Ali Mango, 
members of one of Amman's most prominent business dynasties. On the other 
side of Rainbow Street is a long, low house, the whole facade of which is 
sheltered beneath an elegant Circassian-style porticoed balcony; its most famous 
resident was Said al-Mufti, a Circassian who was prime minister in the 1950s and 
also mayor of Amman. Following Mango Street to the right brings you past more 
cafés and another fine villa, now home to the Royal Film Commission, before 
- on the right - the widely known Books@Café, an attractive bookshop and 
café-bar shoehorned into another historic old house. A few doors further is the 
print gallery Jacaranda, past which the road climbs to a mini-roundabout; to 
the right is the Al-Pasha hammam (see box opposite), while straight on leads past 
shops towards the Shepherd Hotel (see p.94) and 2nd Circle.
Wild Jordan and around
Just below the Mango House, at a T-junction where Rainbow Street ends at a 
set of steep stairs clattering down the hill into Downtown, if you walk left 
(slightly uphill) on Othman bin Affan Street you'll come to the striking Wild 
Jordan centre, designed by architect Ammar Khammash for the Royal Society 
for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN). It is also reachable from 1st Circle by 
taking the fourth turning on the left and following the street round.
Inside, as well as information about how to visit Jordan's nature reserves, 
you'll find a A nature shop (daily 9am-5pm) selling all kinds of pieces 
designed in traditional style by Jordanian craftworkers - often rural women - 
ranging from jewellery to painted ostrich eggs and handwoven bags. Also on 
sale are organic herbs, dried fruits and spices, produced on the reserves. There 
are often free exhibitions of photographs or art inspired by Jordan's natural 
environment. The cool, shaded balcony of the excellent café here (see p.116) 
- which serves organic food, drinks and smoothies - offers one of Amman's

most spectacular views, looking over the valleys of Downtown and across to 
Jebel al-Qal'a. Opposite, between the hills, rises a gigantic flagpole with - if 
the wind is low - an enormous Jordanian flag fluttering lazily. The pole stands 
a shade under 127m high, and the flag itself is 30m by 60m - an impressive 
visual monument, but not a world record. A few doors along from Wild Jordan 
is the beautiful Nabad art gallery, housed in a particularly fine old villa with 
a secluded rear terrace.
The other direction at the T-junction - downhill - leads into Kherfan Street: 
a stroll along from the corner stands Beit Shocair, an old three-storey villa in 
the Syrian style, with rooms opening off a central courtyard with a fountain. It's 
worth stopping here: the house is full of atmosphere, the terrace has another 
wonderful view and several artists rent space here to sell crafts, jewellery and 
lanterns. A café is also planned.
Jebel al-Lweibdeh
Amman has a dynamic contemporary arts scene, and some of the best galleries 
are within walking distance of each other in the neat, respectable neighbour-
hood of Jebel al-Lweibdeh, overlooking the hubbub of Downtown. The area 
has a relatively high proportion of Christian residents, and you'll find a tangibly 
different atmosphere from other parts of the city: many women are unveiled, 
there is less of a laid-back streetlife, and you may well hear the unfamiliar sound 
of church bells.
Darat al-Funun
A few minutes' walk above Downtown stands an idyllic refuge from the noise and 
bustle. Head for Omar al-Khayyam Street, which leads steeply up behind the 
Downtown post office; turning right at the first hairpin, you'll soon come in sight 
of a high stone wall. With gates to left and right, this wall defines the grounds of 
Darat al-Funun (Sat-Thurs 10am-7pm; T06 464 3251, Wwww.daratalfunun
.org; free), a lush haven of tranquillity housing a centre for contemporary Arab art. 
The "little house of the arts", as its name translates, comprises a set of three 1920s 
villas in a beautiful, shaded hillside garden, within which lie the remains of the 
small sixth-century Byzantine Church of St George. The "Blue House", at the 
top of the steeply terraced complex, houses changing exhibitions, and its wooden 
porch - a common feature of Circassian architecture, added to the building as an 
acknowledgment of the Circassian presence in the city - serves as a tiny café, 
Amman's most beautiful and peaceful. On the same level is the former home of 
Emir Abdullah's court poet, now a private studio for visiting artists. Below is the 
main building, the former official residence of Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick 
Souk Jara
In the summer months, don't miss Souk Jara, a popular, easy-going ﬂea market of 
antiques, crafts, T-shirts and other streetwear, art and food. Established by JARA (the 
Jebel Amman Residents' Association; Wwww.jara-jordan.com), it is held on Fawzi 
Malouf Street, just off Rainbow Street, every Friday between mid-May and early 
September, from 10am to 10pm, and often includes impromptu concerts, ﬁlm 
screenings and other activities. The website has more details.
There is a map of Jebel al-Lweibdeh on p.93.

Peake, or "Peake Pasha", British Commander of the Arab Legion in the 1920s and 
1930s. It sports a wonderful semicircular portico and has been superbly renovated 
by Jordanian architect Ammar Khammash to house well-lit galleries, studios and 
an excellent art library. Legend has it that, on his stay in late 1921 as a guest of 
Peake, T.E. Lawrence wrote much of Seven Pillars of Wisdom in this building.
Exhibitions at Darat al-Funun vary from grand overviews of contemporary 
Arab art to small shows from local artists, with everything publicized on the 
gallery website. There are also plenty of lectures and performances, often 
staged atmospherically in the ruined church, and all events are free to the public. 
Even if art isn't your strong point, dropping in gives a sense of a flourishing side 
of Jordanian culture that's barely touched upon by most visitors.
Makan and Dar al-Anda
If you turn left out of the top gate of Darat al-Funun, a short walk straight ahead 
and then behind the al-Saadi mosque will bring you to another of Jebel al-
Lweibdeh's arts centres, Makan (T06 463 1969, Wwww.makanhouse.net). It's a 
small, alternatively minded place started up by the enthusiastic Ola Khalidi that 
stages exhibitions and events, and also serves as a venue for informal concerts and 
film-screenings - links with the Amman Filmmakers' Cooperative (Wwww.alif
.com) are strong. Its balcony has another spectacular view out over the city.
Further along the same street, ochre adobe walls announce Dar al-Anda
(T06 462 9599, Wwww.daralanda.com), a gallery and cultural centre staging 
concerts, workshops and arts events. The original building, which was built in 
1939, has been beautifully restored, and - along with newer buildings around 
the courtyard - now houses a library for children, a studio, a guest apartment 
for resident artists, and so on. Opening hours for both vary (and often include 
a break in mid-afternoon), but it's worth popping by on the off-chance to see 
what's happening.
National Gallery
Leaving from the top gate of Darat al-Funun, it's a stiff five-minute climb north 
past the Luzmila Hospital to the roundabout known as Lweibdeh Circle on top 
of the hill; the little park on the roundabout has been prettified thanks to the 
Art in Amman
Aside from the National Gallery and the three galleries mentioned in this section 
(Darat al-Funun, Makan and Dar al-Anda), there are many other ways to access 
Amman's art scene: below are just a few. Current shows are publicized in the Jordan
Times. Nabad (Wwww.nabadartgallery.com) stands just off Rainbow Street, 
showcasing changing exhibitions in an atmospheric, traditional villa setting. Umm 
Uthayna hosts the Orfali Gallery (Wwww.orfali.net), which also hosts concerts and 
other events, and the Foresight32 Gallery (Wwww.foresightartgallery.com), also an 
exhibition venue and cultural centre. Nearby in Sweiﬁyyeh the Broadway Gallery
(Wwww.broadway-gallery.com) stages local shows. The Gallery, at the InterConti-
nental Hotel, is a long-standing favourite, displaying paintings and photographs. As 
well as bank buildings and hotels, cafés such as Canvas, Blue Fig, Duinde and others 
(see p.112) host shows by local artists, as does the Al-Hussein Cultural Centre in Ras 
al-Ain. Just out of town in Fuheis (see p.148), Rowaq al-Balqa (Wwww.rowaq.net) 
showcases contemporary Jordanian art in a rural village setting. It's also worth 
looking online at the work of Ammar Khammash (Wwww.khammash.com), an artist, 
designer and architect who has worked on several high-proﬁle projects in the capital 
and nationwide.

French Embassy and renamed "Square de Paris". Ten minutes or so from here on 
the flat along quiet, shady Shari'a College Street, past the Terra Sancta religious 
academy, will bring you to Muntazah Circle, an oval expanse of green lined with 
elegant town houses. One of these, on the right, is the Jordan National Gallery 
of Fine Arts (daily 9am-7pm; closed Tues & Fri; JD3; Wwww.nationalgallery
.org), also reached on a short, signposted walk from Abdali. This is the country's 
premier establishment showcase for contemporary art, with artists from Jordan, 
the Arab world and the wider Islamic world all represented in a changing 
programme of shows drawing on the 2000-work permanent collection. Exhibi-
tions are split between the main building and an annexe in a town house opposite; 
take time to stroll in the pleasant garden between the two, which (at one end) also 
houses the chic Canvas art lounge and café (see p.112).
Further aﬁeld
Aside from exploring the excellent shopping possibilities (for more on which, 
see p.117), there are few specific sights to head for in the busy, sprawling neigh-
bourhoods of West Amman.
Hidden among the fashion boutiques of Sweifiyyeh is a Byzantine mosaic, 
discovered by chance in the garden of a private house in 1969. The mosaic, of 
which only the left-hand portion survives, originally formed the floor of a late 
sixth-century church and is in a good state of preservation. Bordered with foliage, 
it depicts a red-tongued lion, a laden donkey and more, along with white-bearded 
faces in each corner, personifications of the seasons. It lies on the main Hamra 
Street, protected under a roofed shelter, but was locked and unattended at the 
time of writing (previously open Mon-Thurs & Sat 8am-2pm; free).
On the northern edge of the Sports City stadium in Shmeisani is the 
Martyrs' Memorial (Sarh ash-Shaheed; Sat-Thurs 9am-4pm; free), Jordan's 
national military museum, housing a display of military memorabilia from 
the Great Arab Revolt of 1916-17 to the present day. It's a moving, worth-
while visit.
Royal Automobile Museum and Children's Museum
Following King Hussein's death in 1999, King Abdullah II established in his 
father's memory the Royal Automobile Museum (Mon & Wed-Sun 10am-
7pm; JD3; Wwww.royalautomuseum.jo). This fine building, designed by star 
Jordanian architect Jafar Touqan, blends in with its natural surroundings by 
being partly sunk into the earth and clad in untreated stone. The interior is 
wonderfully airy and spacious. From the entrance hall, you wander through the 
exhibition areas, adorned with vehicles with a royal connection, ranging from a 
1916 Cadillac through some elegant Rolls-Royces (and even a 1952 Triumph 
Thunderbird motorbike) to a Porsche 911 turbo. Images, dioramas and notice-
boards give background information to the various vehicles so beloved of King 
Hussein and his predecessors.
The museum is set within the Al-Hussein National Park, a large tract of 
hilly land on the western outskirts of the city, off King Abdullah II Street. This 
is Amman's favourite green space, and many people come out here - especially 
on a Friday - to stroll, picnic or play games. At the highest point of the park is 
a monument to King Hussein, while alongside the Automobile Museum is the 
wonderful Children's Museum Jordan (Sat-Thurs 9am-6pm, Fri 10am-7pm; 
closed Tues; JD3; Wwww.cmj.jo), another superbly designed building - by 
Jordanian architects Faris & Faris - that is packed with toys, games, hands-on 
exhibits, art equipment and all kinds of fun for kids, from toddlers to teens, 
including a gift shop and on-site restaurant.

East Amman
Wealthy West Amman is the most accessible part of the city outside Downtown, 
and you're unlikely to have much reason to visit the city's other, chiefly low-
income neighbourhoods, often collectively dubbed East Amman, even though 
they spread to north, east and south. The deepening gap of culture and affluence 
between the two "halves" of the city leads local wags to claim that you need a 
passport these days to cross from West to East Amman; that's an exaggeration, 
but if you venture out to the handful of landmarks in the east - the Hejaz
Railway Museum, for instance, or the Cave of the Seven Sleepers 
pilgrimage site - you'll certainly feel as if you've left the ritzy shops and hotels 
of West Amman far behind.
Hejaz Railway Museum
The Mahatta district, about 2km east of Downtown, is home to the Hejaz
Railway Museum (Sun-Thurs 8am-2pm; JD1; T06 489 5413), occupying 
one of the century-old red-roofed stone buildings that comprise Amman's old 
railway station on the Hejaz line that originally ran between Damascus and 
Medina (see box overleaf). It stands on King Abdullah I Street, at the foot of the 
hill that climbs towards Marka. The museum itself is a modest affair, comprising 
models, railway memorabilia, maps, bits of old equipment and so on - though 
a revamp was announced in 2009, so things may have moved on by the time 
you visit. Just as exciting is the chance to roam the yards and train sheds - still 
home to many fine old locomotives - chat with the engineers and explore the 
restored Pullman carriages. You can normally turn up unannounced, though it's 
always best to phone ahead.
Abu Darwish Mosque
Perched over Downtown to the south is Jebel al-Ashrafiyyeh, the highest 
and steepest hill in the city, topped by the peculiar black-and-white-striped 
Abu Darwish Mosque, built in 1961 by a Circassian immigrant. On the 
inside it's unremarkable, but outside, it's an Alice-in-Wonderland palace, 
complete with a row of black-and-white chess pawns atop its walls and 
multicoloured fairy lights after dark. It is visible from points around the city 
- including, memorably, from the terrace at Books@Café on Jebel Amman 
(see p.105). The only other reason to come up here is for the panoramic 
view, yet there are no clear sightlines from street level; you'll have to - subtly 
- get onto the roof of one of the apartment buildings just down from the 
mosque. Any effort will be amply rewarded, though, especially early in the 
morning or after sunset: from this high up, the entire city is laid out like a 
relief map at your feet.
Cave of the Seven Sleepers
In the southeastern outskirts, tucked away in the run-down suburb of Abu 
Alanda, the Cave of the Seven Sleepers (daily 8am-5pm; free) - known in 
Arabic as Ahl al-Kahf - is a pilgrimage site associated with a story recorded in 
the Quran about seven young Christian men who escaped Roman religious 
persecution by hiding in a cave. God put them to sleep for hundreds of years, 
and when they awoke, their attempts to buy food with ancient coins aroused 
incredulity. The youths were taken to the governor - by that time a Christian - 
who realized that a miracle had occurred, and ordered celebrations. Their work 
of enlightenment done, the men returned to the cave, where God put them to 
sleep for good.
AMMAN | East Amman

The atmospheric cave, one of many Byzantine rock-cut tombs nearby, is set 
into the hillside next to a modern mosque, built to service the tide of people 
who come to pay their respects. In antiquity, a small church was built literally 
on top of the cave: the mihrab of its later conversion into a mosque is directly 
overhead. The decorated entrance, shaded by an ancient olive tree, is topped 
by five medallions, one of which is a cross. Inside are alcoves with four 
sarcophagi, one of which has a much-worn hole through which you can 
peek at an eerie jumble of bones. The walls show remains of painted decora-
tion, with a curious eight-pointed star recurring many times - a Byzantine 
Christian symbol.
To reach the site, head 4km south from Downtown, over Jebel al-Ashrafi-
yyeh and through the low-income neighbourhood of Wihdat to the major 
traffic intersection of Middle East Circle (duwaar ash-sharq al-awsat). Keep 
The Hejaz railway
The plan to build a railway to facilitate the Muslim pilgrimage, long touted in the 
Ottoman capital, Istanbul, was ﬁnally approved by the sultan in the 1890s. At that 
time, a camel caravan travelling the 1300km from Damascus to the holy cities of 
Medina and Mecca, in the Hejaz region of western Arabia, took the best part of two 
months - a difﬁcult journey through harsh country that left the pilgrims vulnerable to 
exhaustion, disease and bandits. The train, it was proposed, would cut this to a mere 
three days. The route chosen for the line (and the adjacent Desert Highway that 
came later) followed almost exactly the pilgrimage route in use since the sixteenth 
century. By 1908, with goodwill funds pouring in from all over the Islamic world, 
modern, comfortable carriages, a luxury Pullman car and even a rolling mosque (with 
two-metre minaret) were running three times a week along the full length of the line 
from Damascus to Medina, bringing new wealth and sophistication to villages such 
as Amman and Ma'an along the route.
During World War I, Faysal and Abdullah, the sons of Sherif Hussein of Mecca, and 
the British colonel T.E. Lawrence ("of Arabia"), organized the Arab Revolt in the Hejaz 
(more information on p.371). They moved north up the rail line, harassing the Turkish 
supply lines, blowing up trains and eventually taking Damascus. After the war and the 
collapse of the Ottoman Empire, money could be found to rebuild the line only as far 
as Ma'an. With its holy raison d'être negated, the railway lay semi-dormant for 
decades, and the only passenger services - between Damascus and Amman - came 
and went, subject to ﬂuctuations in diplomatic relations.
In 1992, a British advertising company hit on the idea of ﬁlming an ad for extra-
strong mints on the old Hejaz steam locomotives, paying the railway handsomely for 
the privilege. More enquiries came in, following which proﬁts from passenger service 
paled into insigniﬁcance beside the requests for special charters from diplomats 
and train buffs wanting nostalgic rides into the desert, and from ﬁlm crews and tour 
operators capitalizing on the legend of Lawrence. Many ﬁve-star package tours to 
Jordan now include an afternoon of champagne and caviar on a steam-drawn 
Pullman, with the added "surprise" of a mid-desert Lawrence-style raid on the train 
by mounted bedouin warriors.
However, these charters all head south from Amman into the desert: as this book 
went to press, service on the line northwards to Damascus - used far more for freight 
than passengers - has been suspended, with part of the route subsumed into the 
new Amman-Zarqa light railway. Jordan's transport ministry is also starting to put 
plans in place for a new national rail network that may, it is hoped, link up with the 
high-speed railways currently being built around Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. 
The Hejaz railway itself may have ﬁnally reached the end of the line - but the dream 
that inspired it is back on track.

going south for another 2.4km to a signposted turn to Abu Alanda, which will 
bring you up the hill to a little roundabout in the middle of the neighbour-
hood. Turn right onto Ahl al-Kahf Street, and the cave is 1300m further on. 
By taxi from Downtown, expect to pay JD8-10 for the return trip, with 
waiting time included.
Eating and drinking
Amman has some fine options for eating out. There are numerous first-rate 
Arabic restaurants, but also places offering affordable and surprisingly good 
Indian, Chinese, European and international cuisine. On a tighter budget, you'll 
find dozens of inexpensive local diners, many in Downtown. Ammanis also 
have an incorrigible sweet tooth, which they are constantly placating with visits 
to the city's many patisseries, for honey-dripping pastries and cakes, or its 
coffee houses and cafés, for syrupy-sweet tea and coffee (and soft drinks by 
the crateful). There are bars scattered across the city, ranging from Western-style 
lounges to covert liquor dens in Downtown back alleys.
Cafés and snacks
Coffee houses are tucked away in just about every alley in Downtown. These 
traditional places are often shunned by hip young locals, however, who prefer 
to kill their hours in newer, Western-style pavement cafés in Abdoun, 
Shmeisani and other uptown neighbourhoods (including within all the big 
shopping malls), where people-watching is easier and where women can feel 
more comfortable. If you fancy refreshment on the hoof, stop in at one of the 
juice bars dotted around Downtown and other districts, some doling out 
tamarind, carob and fruit squashes, others serving fresh-squeezed juices of all 
kinds; p.48 has more info.
All the places listed below are marked on the maps on p.82, p.90, p.93 
or p.95.
Turn to p.412 for a list of useful culinary terms in Arabic.
Downtown
Auberge Alley off Prince Muhammad St (unmarked 
entrance). Small café one ﬂoor below the Cliff Hotel
and uncompromisingly male. However, the coffee is 
good and the tiny balcony a great place to watch 
the street go by.
Centrale King Hussein St, at the corner with King 
Faysal St. Traditional coffee house above the street 
that soaks up the morning sun.
Eco-Tourism Café (aka Al-Rasheed Courts) In an 
alley off King Faysal St, opposite the Arab Bank. 
Downtown's most relaxed and foreigner-friendly 
coffee house, with a younger, hipper crowd than 
most. The balcony - Downtown's best - is a 
pleasant place to hang out and chat with local 
20-somethings, many of whom migrate here from 
uptown West Amman for an after-dark argileh in 
the kind of traditional surroundings Abdoun cannot 
muster.
Habibah King Hussein St, near the corner 
with King Faysal St (Arabic sign only, but it's 
unmissably big, symmetrical blue-on-white). The 
best patisserie in the city, if not the country, piled 
high with every conceivable kind of sweetmeat, 
pastry and biscuit, all very affordable. There's a 
mixed-company café upstairs for eat-ins. Smaller 
pop-in branches are dotted around the city, 
including very nearby - just off King Faysal St next 
to the "Duke's Diwan".
Jabri King Hussein St, close to Habibah. Another 
patisserie institution, with much the same stock as 
Habibah, plus OK ice cream. Also with a mixed 
upstairs restaurant for coffee and sweets or a full 
meal. Branches in Shmeisani and elsewhere.

Jebel Amman
Bakehouse Just off Rainbow St, below 1st Circle. 
Small, one-room coffee shop tucked away in the 
shopping streets behind the British Council - 
bagels, mufﬁns and (so many expats claim) the 
best cup of coffee in Amman. Closes around 6pm.
Batata Rainbow St, below 1st Circle. Jordan's only 
local-style "chippy" for takeaway French fries, 
freshly prepared with a choice of sauces - good, 
cheap and piping hot.
Books@Café Mango St, just off Rainbow 
St, below 1st Circle Wwww.booksatcafe
.com. A funky, urban atmosphere unlike anywhere 
else in Jordan, with a bookshop downstairs and 
great coffee, smoothies and light meals upstairs. 
Wonderful terrace views and a friendly clientele are 
pluses. Well worth a visit.
Duinde Rainbow St, below 1st Circle Wwww
.salam-kanaan.com. Beautiful, atmospheric little 
corner café in this strollable neighbourhood, with 
an eclectic array of shabby-chic furniture, works by 
local artist Salam Kanaan and found objects 
creating a seductively laid-back ambience.
Reem 2nd Circle. A hole-in-the-wall pavement 
stand, serving Amman's most ﬂavourful and 
succulent shawerma, bar none. At lunchtime, early 
evening and around midnight, this little place is 
single-handedly responsible for slowing the trafﬁc 
around 2nd Circle - cars, limos and taxis triple-
park as drivers head over from around the city to 
collect family-sized orders.
Wild Jordan Othman bin Affan St, just off Rainbow 
St. Wonderful organic café with the best view in 
Amman. See p.105.
Jebel al-Lweibdeh
Canvas Opposite National Gallery T06 
463 2211. Chic, elegantly designed café-
restaurant set amid a quiet garden directly midway 
between the two buildings of the National Gallery. 
A cool, arty retreat, with sofas for chilling out and 
exhibitions by local artists on the walls. A popular 
spot for relaxed weekend brunches: think quesa-
dillas, salads and wraps (JD6-12 or so). Book 
ahead on Fridays.
Darat al-Funun Opposite Luzmila Hospital. 
This gallery complex and arts centre (see 
p.106) has the quietest, most attractive little 
open-air café in Amman, hidden among shady 
gardens. Open until 6pm. Closed Fri.
Shmeisani
el-Farouki Central Shmeisani. The most congenial 
of Shmeisani's coffee houses, with good, fresh-
roasted coffee (Arabic-style or ﬁlter) and a relaxed 
backroom where women can puff in peace.
Frosti Beside el-Farouki. Amman's ﬁnest ice cream 
and frozen yoghurt, bar none, with takeaway or 
outdoor seating.
Sultan An-Nahda Street. Huge, popular pavement-
side café (one of several on this main drag), with a 
big terrace to watch the people and trafﬁc stream by.
Abdoun
Caffè Moka Al-Qaherah St, Abdoun Circle. Rather 
pretentious little Italian-style café-cum-patisserie 
with a clientele of rich kids and ladies who lunch. 
Nonetheless, the food - salads, light meals and 
pastries - is good and the coffee is worth 
paying for.
Sanabel Abdoun Circle. Chic patisserie in the heart 
of Abdoun, with an attractive glass-fronted eating 
area looking out over the bustle.
Tché Tché Abdoun Circle. Relaxed postmodern-
style café that attracts ﬂocks of hip young 
Ammanis, male and female, who hang out, gossip 
and smoke top-quality hubbly-bubbly. Branches 
around West Amman.
Restaurants
Amman's restaurants cover a broad spectrum, from backstreet canteens ladling 
meat stew to air-conditioned palaces serving international delicacies. There is 
also plenty of opportunity for cheap and tasty snacking: falafel sandwiches and 
bowls of fuul or hummus are unbeatable, and street shawerma stands are every-
where (Amman's best shawerma, however, is from Reem on 2nd Circle; see 
above). All the better restaurants, and virtually all the non-Arabic places, are 
located in uptown districts.
In addition to the places listed here, you could copy some Ammanis and drive 
down to the big hotels on the Dead Sea for a special dinner: each hotel (see 
p.132) has several restaurants covering diverse cuisines, and the high quality of 
food and service - combined with the romantic setting - makes for a 
memorable evening out. The journey (45min there, an hour coming back) takes 
only a bit longer than crossing Amman through heavy traffic.

Many upmarket restaurants provide valet parking for diners. A reasonable tip, 
presuming that you're not left standing around waiting, is 1JD.
All the restaurants listed below are marked on the maps on p.82, p.90, p.93 or 
p.95.
Secondhand smoke
It's very difﬁcult to avoid secondhand smoke wherever you go: cigarette smoke 
and more fragrant postprandial argileh smoke are both very common, with acrid 
cigar smoke an occasional hazard in the ﬁve-star hotel restaurants. To avoid it, try 
eating earlier than is usual - booking for lunch at 12.30pm, say, or for dinner at 7pm 
- and thereby leaving before the place ﬁlls up. Nonetheless you may still ﬁnd people 
around you lighting up before, during and after the meal, oblivious to diners at 
neighbouring tables. When reserving, mention clearly that you'd like to be seated in 
a no-smoking area (which, if it exists, is almost always hidden away in the back 
somewhere) - but, depending on the restaurant's facilities and how busy it is, you 
should still be prepared to have to put up with fumes: smoke-free areas are simply 
not in high demand.
Arabic
Budget
Cairo Down a side-street behind the Husseini 
Mosque, Downtown. The most convivial of a trio of 
celebrated Downtown diners (the others are al-
Quds and Hashem), serving basic fare such as 
roast chicken and stew. You'd have to stuff yourself 
to part with more than JD2.50; expect to share a 
table. Daily 8am-11pm.
Hashem In an alley opposite Cliff Hotel, 
Downtown. A fast-paced outdoor diner that 
is an Amman institution, founded by restaurateur 
Hashem al-Turk in the 1920s. Tables are set out 
all down the shaded alley, as well as in a couple 
of internal rooms, and there are just two dishes to 
choose from - fuul (hot beans) or hummus. Ask 
for fuul and you'll get the standard Jordanian 
version (see p.44), but there are plenty of varia-
tions; for instance, fuul masri is Egyptian-style, 
without the chilli but with a dollop of tahini, while 
qudsiyyeh is Jerusalem-style - fuul with a blob of 
hummus in it. All are freshly made, tasty and cost 
pennies. Flat bread, chopped onion and a sprig of 
mint are free (the restaurant gets through a 
staggering 50kg of onions a day). The stand 
opposite sells bags of cheap falafel balls as a 
side-dish, and tea-waiters periodically stride 
around shouting "shy, shebab?" (tea anyone?) - 
grab a glass off the tray. You can eat well for 
JD1.50. Almost all the waiters are Egyptian, 
earning a shade above the minimum wage; tips 
are optional. Daily 24hr.
Kafeteria al-Kuds (Jerusalem) On Rainbow St, 
below 1st Circle, Jebel Amman. Not to be 
confused with the Downtown al-Quds restaurant 
(see below). This is a tiny hole-in-the-wall joint, 
near the British Council, that serves what many 
claim to be the best falafel in Amman. Catch 
them when the falafel is fresh-fried and crispy 
hot, and you'll never look back. Daily about 
noon-9pm or later.
al-Quds King Hussein St, next to Habibah patis-
serie, Downtown. The best restaurant in Downtown 
(which isn't saying much), serving a range of rather 
overcooked Arabic specialities, including the 
celebrated bedouin speciality mensaf (lamb with 
rice). Prices are reasonable - a full meal needn't 
set you back more than JD3 or so - but the menu 
is in Arabic only and the waiters won't stop to chat. 
Daily 7am-11pm. 
Tarweea Part of the Haya Cultural Centre, roughly 
opposite KFC in Shmeisani. The classiest low-cost 
Arabic restaurant in the city (tarweea is Lebanese 
dialect for "brunch"), an intimate and spotlessly 
clean place that is a quality alternative to Shmeisa-
ni's junk-food ﬁxation, and streets ahead of 
anything Downtown. Music from the Egyptian diva 
Umm Kalthoum plays at a comfortable decibel level 
and the uniquely friendly waiters will talk you 
through the menu. Highlights include an excellent 
Lebanese fatteh, tasty giant-sized stuffed falafel 
balls and plenty of varieties of fuul and hummus, 
not to mention kebabs and a free platter of pickles, 
olives, mint and rocket leaves that's almost a dish 
in itself. Don't miss their fresh-baked manaqeesh
zaatar bread. A meal here is unlikely to set you 
back more than JD4. Daily 24hr.
Mid-range and expensive
Bourj al-Hamam At InterContinental Hotel, 2nd 
Circle, Jebel Amman T06 464 1361. Exquisite

Lebanese cuisine in this elegant hotel restaurant, 
serving all the classic mezze dishes with style and 
pinpoint authenticity. Generally packed nightly: this 
is a classy dining spot for business people and the 
city's elite. Expect JD20 a head. Daily 12.30-
3.30pm & 7.30-11.30pm.
Fakhr el-Din 40 Taha Hussein St, behind 
Iraqi Embassy, between 1st and 2nd 
Circles, Jebel Amman T06 465 2399, Wwww
.fakhreldin.com. One of Jordan's best restau-
rants, catering to the royal and diplomatic upper 
crust and housed in a tasteful 1920s villa, 
renovated by top architect Ammar Khammash 
and retaining its old-world atmosphere of under-
stated charm. The food - formal Lebanese 
cuisine with a Syrian twist - is as impeccable as 
the service, yet judicious choices can keep the 
bill around JD15 - not, however, if you indulge in 
the highly acclaimed, but expensive, raw meat 
platter, which includes ﬁne kibbeh nayeh. 
Unusually for an Arabic restaurant, leave space 
for dessert: both the osmaliyyeh (crispy shredded 
pastry over fresh cream, doused in syrup) and 
muhallabiyyeh (rose-scented almond cream 
pudding) are exquisite. Reservations essential, 
especially in summer for dining on the patio amid 
the lemon trees. Daily 1-4pm & 7-11pm.
Haret Jdoudna Excellent Arabic restaurant, worth 
the trip to nearby Madaba. See p.230.
Houwara On King Abdullah II St (aka Medical 
City St), north of 8th Circle towards Sweileh T06 
535 4210. Attractive mid-priced Lebanese 
restaurant set back from the ring road on the 
city's western edge. Decor, with wooden lattice 
screens and art on the walls, is attractive, and 
the food is very good: there's a hefty range of 
mezze including a spot-on muhammara (a 
delicately spiced nut-based dip), quality 
shanklish, plus tabbouleh and samakeh harra as 
good as you'd expect (the latter a speciality of 
the Lebanese port of Tripoli, ﬁsh with onions, nuts 
and spiced tahini). The shish tawook is good, and 
the kebabs and mixed grills especially tender. In 
the tradition of upscale Arabic restaurants, 
though, the service can be over-formal, with a 
horde of waiters hovering to spoon out your 
tabbouleh and constantly ﬁll your glass. Daily 
noon-midnight.
Reem al-Bawadi Just off Duwaar al-Waha (the 
junction of Medina St and Gardens St), Tla'a al-
Ali, suburban West Amman T06 551 5419. 
Delightfully over-the-top kitsch-laden affair 
devoted to showy power-dining (Colonel Gaddaﬁ 
has been known to drop by), complete with tent, 
fake castle, fountains, palm trees and neon lights. 
The menu is in Arabic only, but the waiters are 
happy to talk you through the options; few 
restaurants offer such untrammelled good service 
- formal but not stiff, warm yet discreet. The food 
is excellent, but you'd come as much for the 
atmosphere, and to take a leisurely three or four 
hours over lunch or dinner in a comfortable, 
unhurried setting. Families welcome. No alcohol. 
Daily noon-midnight.
Sahtain At Kan Zaman tourist village T06 412 
8391. A classy out-of-town restaurant seating four 
hundred diners in subtly lit vaults - it's an atmos-
pheric place to eat a good (though overpriced) 
buffet, with Arabic music and dance nightly. See 
p.119 for details of how to reach Kan Zaman. Daily 
7pm-midnight, also Fri 1-4pm.
Tannoureen Shatt al-Arab St, Souk Umm Uthayna 
T06 551 5987. On balance, this is probably the 
best Arabic restaurant in Jordan - award-winning 
Lebanese cuisine of the highest quality in an 
elegant, expensive setting. Hardened restaurant 
critics, with an eye for a fake, declare the mezze
here to be "out of this world" - the only difﬁculty is 
choosing from the long list of options, both hot and 
cold. You'll have trouble leaving space for a main 
course, but try: the shish tawook is exquisite, and 
the kebabs and mixed grill perfectly tender and 
ﬂavour-rich. Desserts are spectacular, but not many 
diners make it that far. The courteous service is 
unusually warm and understated, as is the decor, 
which includes many paintings of old Jordanian 
and Palestinian villages. All in all, quite an experi-
ence. JD20 per head and upwards. Booking 
essential. Daily 1-4pm & 7-11pm.
Zad el-Khair 45 Faisal bin Abdul-Azeez St, Umm 
Uthayna T06 554 0057, Wwww.zadelkhair.com. 
Outstanding Iraqi restaurant, acclaimed by 
Amman's many Iraqi expats as serving the best 
food this side of the Tigris. Alongside a welter of 
Lebanese mezze and kebabs, the signature dish 
is masqoof, Baghdadi river ﬁsh (usually carp) 
dried in the sun, baked in clay, split and then 
barbecued whole in a distinctive clasp. It arrives 
at the table steaming and fragrant, with the ﬂesh 
sweet and buttery, scooped out by hand with 
pieces of torn ﬂat bread. Served alongside is 
amba, a Baghdadi sauce of mango and turmeric 
displaying Indian inﬂuence. A memorable experi-
ence in a sophisticated setting, aided by 
courteous service and Iraqi music. Booking 
essential. Daily 1-4pm & 7-11pm.
Zuwwadeh Excellent Arabic restaurant in nearby 
Fuheis. See p.148.

known as "Abu Khalil", after the owner) that's been 
around for years, with a dedicated East Asian expat 
clientele. The food is good, and with careful selec-
tions it's easy to keep the outlay around JD10. 
Daily noon-3.30pm & 7pm-midnight.
Indochine At Grand Hyatt Hotel, 3rd Circle T06
465 1234. Outstanding Vietnamese restaurant, 
furnished with louvred doors, rattan and wooden 
ceiling fans to evoke the colonial-era 1930s. 
Excellent food ranges from starters like Thai beef 
salad, deep-fried spring rolls and shrimp fritters to 
mains such as prawns and straw mushrooms in 
spicy lemongrass soup, ginger chicken simmered 
in caramel, and shrimp satay in peanut sauce. 
From around JD20 per head. Booking essential. 
Daily 6.30pm-midnight.
Indu At InterContinental Hotel, 2nd Circle, Jebel 
Amman T06 464 1361. Expensive but spectacu-
larly good Indian food, served in a subtle, sophisti-
cated dining area away from the bustle of the 
hotel's lobby cafés and restaurants. Tandoori is a 
speciality and there's plenty for vegetarians. Look 
out for the changing menus of regional Indian 
dishes. Daily 12.30-3.30pm & 7.30-11.30pm.
Noodasia Abdoun Circle T06 593 6999. Great, 
lively Asian restaurant. Decor is chic and contem-
porary (think dark wood and polished chrome), and 
the food delicious: the spring rolls are perhaps the 
best in Amman, pad Thai or Szechuan beef are 
popular staples and the sushi is outstanding. 
Presentation is immaculate, service efﬁcient. Daily 
12.30-3.30pm & 7-11.30pm.
Ren Chai Off 4th Circle T06 462 5777, Wwww
.renchai.com. Amman's leading Chinese restaurant, 
offering a swanky, super-cool dining experience, 
whether on the open terrace or in the sleek 
designer interior. Dim sum, soups and sizzling 
mains are all authentically prepared, while delica-
cies including abalone and lobster ﬁll out a long, 
varied menu. Daily noon-3pm & 7-11.30pm.
European
Blue Fig Amir Hashem St, Abdoun T06 
592 8800, Wwww.blueﬁg.com. A casual 
café/bar, designed by one of Jordan's top archi-
tects, that draws in a sleek, chic crowd. The 
ambience is cool and sophisticated, with world 
music and fusion beats booming out. The walls 
display works by local artists, and there are 
regular live music sessions. Daily 8.30am-1am. 
Booking essential on Thursday nights and Fridays 
(especially for breakfast/brunch). Branches 
around town.
Bonita Opposite InterContinental Hotel, off 3rd 
Circle T06 461 5061, Wwww.bonitaamman.com. 
The best Spanish restaurant in town, known for its 
paella (one of which is vegetarian) at JD25 for two, 
and also serving "international" cuisine: go for a 
juicy steak (around JD12). Alongside is a tapas bar 
with Mexican beer, dozens of cheap nibbles and 
some live bands. Restaurant daily noon-midnight, 
bar daily 7.30pm-midnight.
Casereccio Off Abdoun Circle T06 593 4772. 
Casual Italian restaurant that gets jammed solid on 
Fridays (when the quality of food and service can 
suffer); on other days, you'll ﬁnd the wood-ﬁred 
pizzas, fresh pastas and crêpes excellent, with a 
meal easily affordable at JD8 or so per head. No 
alcohol. Daily noon-3pm & 7-11pm.
E.V.O.O. At Sheraton Hotel, 5th Circle T06 593 
4111. Classy, spacious Italian restaurant (the name 
stands for Extra Virgin Olive Oil). Ignore the preten-
sion: the food is very good, with a broad selection 
of antipasti prepared immaculately and a long, 
enticing menu of main courses. The decor is 
elegant but not stuffy, the service calm and 
efﬁcient. Expect around JD20 per head. No 
smoking. Daily 12.30-3.30pm & 7.30-11.30pm.
L'Incontro At Grand Hyatt Hotel, 3rd Circle T06
465 1234. A truly elegant place to dine, with 
sophisticated Milanese-chic decor and an attractive 
outside patio. The Italian food is superb, with a 
frequently changing menu, and the service 
outstanding. Bank on JD20 per head. Daily 12.30-
3.30pm & 7.30-11.30pm.
Living Room Opposite InterContinental Hotel, off 
3rd Circle T06 464 4227, Wwww.romero-jordan
.com. Cosy haven above Romero restaurant (see 
below): climb the stairs to enter a classy, wood-
panelled bar, lounge and dining area, where you 
can relax with a beer or tuck into familiar favour-
ites including steak, ribs, sandwiches and even 
sushi. Daily 1pm-1am.
Pizza Reef Medina St, 200m north of Duwaar al-
Waha (the junction of Medina St and Gardens St), 
Tla'a al-Ali, suburban West Amman T06 568 
7087. The best pizza in the city - thin-crust, 
wood-ﬁred fresh to order and not expensive 
(around JD4 for two people). They can make up 
anything you fancy, with or without meat or 
cheese - their unique labneh-and-rocket offering 
with extra rosemary is delectable. Nearby sister 
outlet Pizza Rimini (turn right off Gardens at the 
Best supermarket before Duwaar al-Waha and go 
100m, T06 568 6324) does all the same stuff 
including takeaways. You'll probably need a taxi 
and/or a detailed map to ﬁnd either. Both open 
daily: Reef 4pm-midnight (closed Mon); Rimini
noon-11pm (closed Tues).

that has been around since the 1970s, updated 
with style and elegance. The pastas, risottos and 
meaty mains are spot on, and there's a long wine 
list to accompany. Service is uniquely calm and 
friendly, and the food outstanding, but you could 
get away with as little as JD15 per person. Daily 
1-4pm & 7-11pm.
Wild Jordan Othman bin Affan St, off Rainbow 
St, below 1st Circle T06 463 3542, Wwww
.wildjordancafe.com. Wonderful café/restaurant 
attached to the Royal Society for the Conservation 
of Nature's Wild Jordan building (see p.105), with 
a stunning view over Downtown Amman from the 
balcony. Prices are high, but the food is mostly 
organic, with many ingredients grown locally on 
the RSCN nature reserves around Jordan. 
Examples include spinach and mushroom salad 
with hazelnut and lime dressing, smoked salmon 
on wild rocket, lean steak sandwich, wholewheat 
spaghetti with light pesto, and so on (all these 
JD5-10). Their smoothies are sensational - and 
don't miss the thirst-quenching frozen lemonade 
with fresh mint. Daily 11am-midnight. Booking 
advisable on Fridays.
North American
Champions At Marriott Hotel, Shmeisani T06 
560 7607. A roomy, lively American diner-cum-
sports-bar, crammed with TVs. Food includes 
nachos, burgers and fajitas, in enormous portions; 
wash it all down with a pitcher of beer. JD12 sees 
you stuffed. English football is shown live, as is 
every other conceivable sporting occasion. Alcohol 
also served during Ramadan. Daily noon-1am.
Cinco de Mayo At InterContinental Hotel, 2nd 
Circle T06 464 1361. Tacos, burritos and fajitas,

past the expense-account journos at the bar. Daily 
12.30-3.30pm & 7.30-11.30pm.
Houston's 11th of Ab St, Shmeisani T06 562 
0610. Casual Tex-Mex joint, crammed on weekend 
nights. Huge salads, draught beer and the best 
nachos around. Daily noon-midnight.
Bars
Amman has a wide range of bars, from swish upmarket hotel pubs to dingy 
dives in back alleys. All those in Downtown Amman - of which the Jordan Bar, 
behind the Cliff Hotel, is typical - are seedy hangouts devoted to sedentary 
drinking, with no attraction whatsoever other than the alcohol. Uptown neigh-
bourhoods in West Amman offer a classier ambience along with ear-blasting 
sound systems and small dancefloors (Thurs is the big night out). Modesty in 
dress for both men and women goes out the window in these places: T-shirts, 
short skirts and the like are common. Beers are roughly JD4 a bottle for foreign 
imports, the same for a half-litre of draught Amstel.
Blue Fig Amir Hashem St, south of Abdoun Circle 
T06 592 8800, Wwww.blueﬁg.com. A cool ﬁxture 
on West Amman's burgeoning in-scene, whose 
decor and young, wealthy clientele wouldn't look 
out of place in Soho or San Francisco. The 
architect-designed interior is chic and classy, 
taking in a couple of bars, two spacious ﬂoors of 
tables, plus couches dotted around and a terrace 
out back for summer lounging. The food - mostly 
light bites - is great if a little pricey, using local 
and imported ingredients imaginatively. Live music 
weekly. Daily 8.30am-1am. Booking essential for 
Thursday nights.
Books@Café Mango St, just off Rainbow St, below 
1st Circle Wwww.booksatcafe.com. This much-
loved bookstore-cum-café in a beautiful part of 
town is a great place to hang out. The decor is 
colourful and funky, the staff and clientele are 
about as hip as each other and there's always a 
buzz. Sit out on the front terrace, looking across 
the city lights, or lounge inside or on the rear 
terrace (where there's often a big screen showing 
sports or the latest Arabic music videos). Light 
meals and good coffee complete the effect. Daily 
10am-1am.
Irish Pub At Dove Hotel, between 4th and 5th 
Circles. Stalwart of Amman's pub scene - a small, 
appealingly gloomy basement that owes little to the 
Emerald Isle, but nonetheless does a good imitation 
of a British student bar, with lino underfoot, not 
enough places to sit and a cramped danceﬂoor. 
Gets packed out on hectic Thursday nights. Daily 
6pm-2am or so.
JJ's At Grand Hyatt Hotel, 3rd Circle. Super-cool 
nightclub - supposedly members-only, although 
you're unlikely to have any difﬁculty getting in - 
featuring Amman's wealthy uptown set dancing to 
up-to-date music by British DJs. Mon-Sat 
10pm-3am.

Shopping
Shopping is a great way to experience Jordanian culture - and it can bring you 
closer than almost any other activity to understanding what makes Amman tick. 
An excellent way to spend your first morning in the city would be to set 
yourself a modest shopping goal: a domed alarm clock that sounds the call to 
prayer, for instance, or a set of decorative Islamic prayer beads. Head out with a 
few dinars and roam the Downtown shopping streets till you have what you 
want: the item may be worth little, but the process of finding it and buying it 
will be a memorable experience.
King Talal Street, in Downtown, is lined with shops selling household 
goods where you could browse for interesting everyday items; good buys 
include a Turkish coffee service (a tiny pot for boiling the grounds plus six 
handleless cups on a tray) or an argileh, often steel but occasionally brass 
(check the joints carefully for leaks). There are many outlets near the 
Husseini Mosque where you could pick up a simple but attractive cotton-
polyester jellabiyyeh (full-length robe) for less than JD10, or a keffiyeh
(chequered or plain headcloth) for around JD2.50. And some food items can 
make great souvenirs, such as a kilo of fresh-roasted coffee ground with 
cardamom, or a box of succulent dates.
Other fascinating areas for window-shopping (and people-watching) 
include Sweifiyyeh, the grid of streets to the southwest of 6th Circle - 
packed with all kinds of shops from designer boutiques and jewellery shops 
to groceries and cafés (and the chic Al-Baraka Mall): one innovation here is 
Wakalat Street, Amman's first pedestrianized zone, with upscale fashion and 
pavement cafés. The Shmeisani district, around Abdul Hameed Shoman 
Street, is more humdrum, while the shopping area around Firas Circle in 
Jebel Hussein has a different feel, with office workers and ordinary families 
browsing around.
amid loud music. Twinkly views from its plate-
glass windows over the valley are an added draw. 
Daily 7pm-1am.
Vinaigrette At Al-Qasr Metropole Hotel, 
Shmeisani Wwww.vinaigrette-jo.com. Compact 
little bar, also serving light bites. Overlook the 
service (peremptory) and the music (loud) for the 
location. It is perched on the 7th ﬂoor of the 
hotel, which itself stands on one of the highest 
points in Shmeisani: the views all round are 
stunning, even more so at night. The ﬂoor-to-
ceiling windows can be rather disconcerting but 
it's worth booking for a window table nonethe-
less. Daily noon-11.30pm.
Shopping malls
Amman's shopping malls can be great to explore - less glitzy than Dubai's, not as 
bland as those in Europe, and often buzzing with people browsing or hanging out. 
Two of the biggest at the time of writing are Mecca Mall (Wwww.meccamall.jo), 
located near the western end of Mecca Street, and City Mall, not far away on King 
Abdullah II Street (both Sat-Thurs 10am-10pm, Fri 2-10pm; food outlets open 
later). Spread over multiple ﬂoors, these behemoths - with abundant parking - 
take in literally hundreds of shops, dozens of cafés and restaurants, cinemas and 
other entertainment, kids' zones and more. Don't spurn the malls as some kind 
of foreign import: many ordinary Ammanis shop here, and they represent, in their 
own way, as much an authentic expression of modern Jordanian culture as the 
Downtown bazaars.

Souvenirs and local crafts
Compared to Cairo, Jerusalem, Damascus and Aleppo, which all have centuries-
old souks and long traditions of craftsmanship, Amman is a modern lightweight, 
with no memorable bazaars to explore. Where the city scores is in its range of 
bedouin crafts from Jordan and Palestine at prices a fraction of Jerusalem's, 
and - most of all - in some amazingly inexpensive gold.
There's only a handful of genuine craft shops in Amman, most located around 
1st and 2nd Circles, and they tend to be associated with projects to revive or 
nurture the skills of local craftspeople; prices are legitimately high and you're 
certain to be purchasing quality goods. Souvenir shops which are simply retail 
outlets for local or imported merchandise are more numerous: here prices can 
be high without necessarily implying a matching quality. There are many of the 
latter within walking distance of Lweibdeh Circle, which is a good place to 
get a sense of what's available.
 Out and about, Downtown Amman
al-Afghani Opposite the Husseini Mosque, 
Downtown. Also branches around town. Amman's 
most famous souvenir shops, originally founded in 
Palestine in 1862 by a merchant from Kabul and 
still in the same family. The Downtown shop is a 
wonderful little Aladdin's cave, crammed to the 
ceiling with everything from Bohemian glass to 
ornate Cairene Ramadan lamps; serious browsing 
is better undertaken at the branches on Jebel 
al-Lweibdeh.

Buying gold
Prices for gold jewellery in Amman are some of the cheapest in the world. Not only is 
there a constant, massive demand in Jordan for gold, used in marriage dowries, but 
workmanship on gold jewellery is charged by weight here - a scheme which turns out 
to be very economical by world standards. The upshot is that it's well-nigh impossible 
to ﬁnd the same quality of work or purity of gold outside Jordan for less than three or 
four times the Amman price. In the Downtown Gold Souk, you can be paying a measly 
few dinars per gram for ﬁnished pieces in 21-carat gold (which is very popular, partly 
because its orangey-yellow hue looks good against darker skin, and partly because 
its purity and investment value make it most desirable for dowries).
When buying, you have to know, at least sketchily, what you're looking at and what 
you want, and you have to be prepared to devote some hours to making a purchase. 
Browsing from shop to shop to get a sense of the market can be a pleasure: Jordan 
is mercifully free of the kind of tedious hard-sell haggling for which the Middle East 
is notorious. Be aware that there are no hallmarks; instead, look for a stamp 
indicating gold purity in parts per thousand: "875" indicates 21-carat, while "750" is 
18-carat. When you buy, you will be given two receipts: one for the per-gram market 
value of the item, another for the cost of the workmanship. The honour system 
among gold merchants - both in the Downtown Gold Souk and elsewhere - is very 
strong, and means that it is very unlikely you'll be misled. Styles of jewellery vary - 
although everyone will happily make you up a necklace of a gold tag shaped with 
your name in Arabic - and, with prices as low as they are, commissioning a custom-
made piece to your own design doesn't command the kind of absurd prices that the 
same thing in the West might do.
As a footnote, Jordan is a bad place to buy jewels or precious stones, since every-
thing is imported. However, silver is sold in the same way as gold, although it is much 
less popular and you may have to search for it; prices, though, can be absurdly low.
to buy locally produced handmade crafts. Staff 
work as advisers and design consultants to about a 
hundred local craftspeople - mostly rural women - 
who share in the shop's proﬁts. There's a huge 
variety of pieces, everything from olive-wood 
carving to mother-of-pearl, hand-blown glassware, 
textiles of all kinds (including lovely hand- and 
machine-embroidered jackets and dresses), 
jewellery, ceramics, baskets and more, both old 
and new. It also stocks the biggest collection of 
carpets in the country - Jordanian, Iraqi and 
Kurdish, ranging from antique pieces to newly 
mades.
Badr ad-Duja 15 Abu Tammam St, off 2nd Circle 
Wwww.badr-adduja.com.jo. Excellent range of 
crafts, including embroidery, rugs, jewellery, 
glassware, ceramics and home furnishings.

pieces ranging from individual tiles to complete 
room decorations.
Beit al-Bawadi Fawzi Qawuqji St, Abdoun

The Gold Souk A network of alleys off King Faysal 
St, Downtown. Dozens of tiny shops all next to 
each other, selling modern gold jewellery at highly 
competitive prices (see box).
Jordan River Designs Rainbow St, below 1st 
Circle Wwww.jordanriver.jo. A project originally set 
up by Save The Children, selling simple, bright and 
pricey handmade home furnishings from a lovely 
old 1920s-era villa. In the same courtyard is an 
outlet for superb carpets woven by women of the 
Bani Hamida tribe, where you can pick up a small 
wall-hanging for JD30, although reasonably sized 
rugs start from around JD70 and large carpets can 
be as much as JD500.

Moving on from Amman
Amman is the centre of Jordan's transport network. Where your onward 
transport leaves from depends partly on what your destination is and partly on 
how you want to get there. There are four main bus and serveece stations: 
Tabarbour, Wihdat, Muhajireen and Mahatta. Along with the offices of bus 
companies including JETT and Trust, which also serve as termini, departure 
points are widely spaced across the city. Location details are given on p.86. Some 
inter-city buses do not run on Fridays.
To Jerash and the north
Tabarbour, also known as mujemma ash-shamal (North station), is the main 
departure point for buses and serveeces to destinations in the north of Jordan, 
including Jerash, Irbid and Ajloun. To get to Irbid, there are also large, air-con 
coaches run by Hijazi (every 15-20 mins) and JETT (hourly) from Tabarbour 
station. For Umm Qais and the far north, change in Irbid.
To Azraq and the east
The only direct public transport between Amman and points east are minibuses 
from Tabarbour to Mafraq, where you should change for Umm al-Jimal and 
the far desert; and minibuses from Tabarbour or Mahatta to Zarqa, from where 
minibuses depart to Hallabat and Azraq. There is no public transport along the 
Amman-Azraq highway apart from a minibus from Mahatta to Muwaqqar, 
making it impossible to reach Qasr Harraneh and Qusayr Amra without your 
century - it has undergone a makeover to 
become a tourist village, in Ottoman style. Prices 
in the lavish antiques shop are sky-high. Another 
shop nearby sells glassware, jewellery and 
ceramics made by ArtiZaman (you can visit their 
workshops downstairs), although it's easy to ﬁnd 
items of the same quality and design for much 
less elsewhere.
Ola's Secret Garden 38 Kherfan St, off Rainbow 
St, below 1st Circle. Housed in the beautiful Beit 
Shocair (see p.106), this shop sells paintings, 
mosaics, jewellery, home furnishings and clothes 
created by designer Ola Mubaslat. Her designs 
feature natural and organic forms; browsing is a 
pleasure. In the same house, artist Omar Hajawi 
sells his superb handmade brass lanterns, and 
there are plans to open more craft outlets and a 
café.
Silsal Off 5th Circle Wwww.silsal.com. Workshop 
and retail outlet for superb handmade ceramics, 
made on-site in the pottery studio and sold nation-
wide (including in the airport duty-free shop). 
Designs are modern, often incorporating traditional 
elements such as Islamic calligraphy and motifs. 
Beautiful souvenir pieces, as well as everyday 
items such as mugs, bowls and vases.
Souk Ayyadi Mecca Mall Wwww.tamweelcom
.org. Showroom for products created through 
Tamweelcom, the Jordan Micro-Credit Company, 
which was established by the charitable Noor 
al-Hussein Foundation to revive traditional crafts. It 
has created jobs for thousands of mostly rural 
women in a number of schemes around the 
country, producing a wide range of top-quality 
crafts, ceramics, embroidered home furnishings, 
handmade paper and more.
Wild Jordan Othman bin Affan Street, off Rainbow 
St, below 1st Circle Wwww.rscn.org.jo. Within this 
centre, run by the Royal Society for the Conserva-
tion of Nature, is a "nature shop", which sells 
pieces designed in traditional style by Jordanian 
craftworkers - often rural women. These range 
from unusual contemporary jewellery to painted 
ostrich eggs and handwoven bags. Also on sale are 
organic herbs, dried fruits and spices, produced on 
the reserves.

own transport; many travellers resort to hiring a taxi or joining a "tour" run by 
a hotel (see p.195).
To the Dead Sea and west of Amman
Early-morning minibuses (7-9am) from Muhajireen station run direct to the 
"Amman Beach" resort on the Dead Sea, but only if there's demand - likely 
on a Friday. Others stop short at the crossroads town of Shuneh al-Janubi-
yyeh, about 15km north of the Dead Sea. From Shuneh, minibuses head to the 
village of Sweimeh, 3km northeast of the Dead Sea hotels; the driver might be 
willing to take you on to Amman Beach for a little extra.
Transport to towns west of Amman include minibuses from Tabarbour or 
Mahatta to Salt; from Tabarbour to Fuheis; and from Muhajireen to Wadi 
Seer. For the northern Jordan Valley take a bus from Tabarbour to Dayr Alla; 
change there for Pella.
To Petra and the south
Minibuses to Wadi Musa/Petra (3hr) leave from Wihdat station, also known 
as mujemma al-janoob (South station). Departures are more common in the 
morning (from 6.30am onwards) than the afternoon. Serveece-drivers tend to 
quote prices higher than normal to start with; some hopefuls to Petra start as 
high as JD10, although the real price is nearer JD5-6 (or JD4-5 on the bus).
Another way to Petra is a daily round-trip coach run by JETT from its Abdali 
office (T06 566 4146, Wwww.jett.com.jo), departing at 6.30am. Should you 
Petra scams
It's worth being aware of the scams used by some taxi-, serveece- and bus-drivers 
plying the heavily travelled tourist route from Amman to Petra. No public buses, 
minibuses or serveeces from Amman to Petra follow the scenic King's Highway, and 
any drivers who claim they do are trying to gouge you for an inﬂated fare. For 
comparison purposes, the true cost of hiring a private taxi to drive you from Amman 
along the King's Highway to Petra is around JD70-80.
Some of the budget hotels in Amman take advantage of this to offer cut-price 
"tours" to Petra along the King's Highway, stopping off at various places on the way. 
You'll get what you pay for on these: often a driver who speaks little English, a 
cramped, all-day drive, and whistle-stop photo breaks. They can, nonetheless, be an 
economical way to glimpse the countryside. Beware of drivers on the day claiming, 
for instance, that the section of the King's Highway through the Wadi Mujib canyon 
is closed so they have to go on the Desert Highway instead: this is invariably just a 
ploy to get out of a long drive. The most reliable of these King's Highway jaunts to 
Petra is run by the excellent Mariam Hotel in Madaba (see p.224).
Many Amman serveece- and taxi-drivers have deals running with certain hotels in 
Wadi Musa: they bring tourists directly to the hotel, and the hotel pays them 
commission for each one, passing that cost on to you in the form of a higher room 
rate. You may ﬁnd that your taxi-driver offers to phone ahead to a hotel on your 
behalf while driving: if you're able to understand Arabic, you'll hear that, rather than 
asking if they have a room available, he's instead asking how much commission the 
hotel would pay him if he brought you to the door. If the hotel refuses to cough up, 
he'll turn to you and claim it's full before offering to try another. The best way to avoid 
all this is to insist that you get dropped off in the middle of Wadi Musa town so you 
can ﬁnd a hotel independently. In any case, not all hotels in Wadi Musa are recom-
mendable: if a place hasn't made it into our listings on p.271, there's a reason.

choose to make a day-trip of it, the same coach arrives back in Amman around 
7.30pm; in between, you get about six hours in Petra - enough to see a few 
highlights. The fare is JD7 one-way, JD14 return.
Minibuses and serveeces to Karak, Shobak, Tafileh and Ma'an, and a few 
to Qadisiyyeh (for Dana), also leave from Wihdat. If there is no transport to 
Petra, take a bus or serveece to Ma'an, where you might catch a connecting bus 
(if not, a Ma'an-Petra taxi is JD10-12).
Minibuses to Madaba run on various routes from Tabarbour, Mahatta, 
Muhajireen and Wihdat stations, but bear in mind that there is no direct public 
transport from Amman to destinations south of Madaba along the picturesque 
King's Highway: all minibuses and serveeces from Amman use the Desert 
Highway. However, the Mariam Hotel runs its own bus from Madaba to Petra 
along the King's Highway; see p.224 for details.
To Aqaba
There are several options for reaching Aqaba. From Wihdat station, minibuses 
(5hr; about JD6.50) and serveeces (4hr; about JD7.50) depart regularly, the 
drivers touting for business by barking "Aqabaqabaqaba!" over their revving 
engines. JETT (Wwww.jett.com.jo) has large air-con coaches departing daily to 
Aqaba (4hr 30min) from its three Amman offices: at Wihdat station (T06 477 
5663; 8am, 2.30pm, 6pm; JD6.50), Tabarbour station (T06 506 5008; 8.30am, 
1pm, 4.30pm; JD7) and in the Abdali district (T06 566 4146; 6-8 daily: first 
7am, last 7.30pm; JD7). Trust International Transport (T06 581 3427) also runs 
large air-con coaches to Aqaba from its office near the Safeway supermarket by 
7th Circle (4-6 daily: first 7.30am, last 7pm; JD7.50). It's worth calling ahead to 
confirm schedules and to book a seat.
Royal Jordanian (T06 510 0000, Wwww.rj.com) has two flights a day from 
Amman's Queen Alia airport to Aqaba (JD48).
To neighbouring countries
Amman is linked into overland and air networks around the Middle East. The 
two most travelled routes - to Damascus and Jerusalem - are described in 
detail below. Needless to say, your passport and visas must all be in order before 
you buy a ticket or set out on any of these journeys, and don't forget to factor 
in the JD5 departure tax levied at every land and sea border.
To Damascus
Going from Amman to Damascus (about 180km by road) is quick and easy, as 
long as your paperwork is in order. Before you travel - indeed, before you leave 
home - check the latest rules on visas for Syria. At the time of writing, UK 
passport-holders, for instance, cannot get a Syrian visa on the border and must 
buy one in advance (price in London: £32). Rules for other nationalities vary. If 
you need a visa in advance, you must get it from a Syrian Embassy in or near your 
home country; the embassy in Amman will issue a visa only if you hold Jordanian 
residency. Bear in mind, too, the difficulties surrounding Israeli stamps; see p.35.
The simplest method of reaching Damascus is by serveece from any of the 
private companies lining the road either side of the old bus station at Abdali. 
The sign of a part-filled serveece waiting for passengers is an open boot (trunk). 
As soon as you approach, the driver will start touting for business with "Sham, 
Sham, Sham!" (one of the Arabic names for Damascus). The fare is JD11 per 
person. It's common for individuals to buy two seats (or couples to buy three) 
to give a roomier ride - or you can charter the whole car (usually four or five 
AMMAN | Moving on from Amman

123
seats). Serveeces run 24 hours a day and - aside from the driver stashing some 
items to sell in Syria - they go fast and direct in around three hours. Cars 
terminate at the Sumriyeh (Somaria) garage in western Damascus, but may be 
able to drop off elsewhere.
Buses operated by JETT (T06 569 6151, Wwww.jett.com.jo) and their 
Syrian partner Karnak are cheaper than serveeces but slower, partly since they 
have to wait for everyone to clear passport control before continuing. Buses 
depart daily from the JETT office 1km uphill from Abdali - a luxury coach at 
7am (JD8.50) and a regular coach at 3pm (JD7.50). There may be four or five 
extra buses a day in high summer. All terminate at Kadem station in Damascus. 
Other companies around Abdali run buses to Damascus, on various schedules: 
ask around for details.
At the time of writing, passenger trains on the historic Hejaz Railway line 
between Amman and Damascus had been suspended, reportedly permanently. 
Flying takes longer than driving.
To Jerusalem and the West Bank
As the crow flies, Amman and Jerusalem are only about 50km apart, but the 
Jordan Valley and a heavily fortified frontier bridge lie in the way. No buses or 
serveeces run directly between the two cities. The only way to go is with a 
combination of buses and taxis/serveeces, changing at a bridge known to the 
Jordanians as the King Hussein Bridge, or Jissr al-Malek Hussein, and to the 
Israelis and Palestinians as the Allenby Bridge - Gesher Allenby in Hebrew, 
Jissr Allenby in Arabic (Sun-Thurs 8am-4.30pm, Fri & Sat 8am-3pm). On a 
good day, the journey can take as little as two hours; on a bad day, it can be more 
than five. It is not unknown for the bridge to be closed at short notice during 
periods of tension.
From Tabarbour station in Amman, serveeces run direct to the bridge (1hr; 
about JD5); stay on until you reach the foreigners' - not the locals' - terminal. 
After the formalities, you have to sit and wait for anything up to two hours for 
a bus to fill up, which covers no-man's-land on either side of the bridge and 
drops you at the Israeli terminal (10min; JD3).
An easier option is to take the 7am daily JETT bus from JETT's Abdali office 
(T06 566 4146; driver's mobile T079 580 0856); book one day ahead, or turn up 
no later than 6.30am to guarantee a seat. The JD7.50 fare (which doesn't include 
Amman-Jerusalem: the bureaucracy
The contradictory bureaucracy surrounding the journey from Amman to Jerusalem is 
grotesque. The Jordanians view the West Bank as being intimately linked with Jordan: 
if you have a single-entry Jordanian visa and cross the King Hussein/Allenby Bridge to 
spend time in the West Bank or Israel, then return the same way to Jordan, the Jorda-
nians don't see you as ever having left the country and you don't need to buy a new 
Jordanian visa, as long as your current one is still within its validity (bear in mind, 
though, the unusually high Israeli departure tax - see p.36). You must buy a new 
Jordanian visa if you return to the country having used any other route out or in.
However, once you cross the King Hussein Bridge from Jordan into the West Bank, 
the Israeli authorities view you as arriving in Israel proper, and routinely issue free 
tourist visas on arrival, valid throughout Israeli- and Palestinian-administered West 
Bank territory and Israel itself (as yet, the Palestinians do not issue their own visas). 
As a foreigner, you'll be waved through any checkpoints on the "Green Line" between 
the West Bank and Israel proper, a border you'll ﬁnd marked on Jordanian maps but 
not Israeli ones.

departure tax) takes you across to the Israeli terminal. Beware the bus-driver taking 
the passports of all the passengers to give en masse to the immigration officials for 
stamping; if you want yours to stay unsullied, take it in to them yourself.
At passport control at the Israeli arrivals terminal, you should be loud and 
clear in asking for your passport not to be stamped: many travellers have 
reported the Israeli immigration officials forgetting after being asked only once. 
For more on the Israeli stamps issue, see p.35. There's a bank to change money. 
A serveece (sheroot in Hebrew) will be waiting outside; the one-hour ride to 
East Jerusalem, dropping you at the Damascus Gate of the Old City, costs 
about 35 Israeli shekels (NIS). If you walk out of the bridge terminal and to 
your right, you'll find the exit area from the locals' building, where you can pick 
up buses to West Bank cities such as Jericho, Bethlehem and Ramallah.
To Tel Aviv and Nazareth
Buses run direct from Amman to the Israeli cities of Nazareth (Lower 
Nazareth; daily 8.30am; JD30) and Tel Aviv (Central Bus Station; Sun-Fri 
8.30am; JD35). Trust International Transport (T06 581 3427) is the Jordanian 
side of the operation. All buses leave from outside their office, which is at the 
corner of Saleh al-Smadi and Ibn al-Fata streets near Safeway supermarket by 
7th Circle. They travel first to Irbid, then cross using the northern Sheikh
Hussein Bridge; at no point do you pass through the West Bank. Arrive at least 
half an hour before departure for security checks. Flying from Amman's Queen 
Alia airport to Tel Aviv - at the time of writing only possible on Royal 
Jordanian (T06 510 0000, Wwww.rj.com), at around JD175 one-way - offers 
the lure of spectacular views over the Dead Sea. There are usually two flights a 
day; flight time is around thirty minutes.
To Cairo
Buses do run from Amman to Cairo, though it's an uncomfortable journey of 
at least 20 hours; you'd do better to break your journey in Aqaba and/or the 
Sinai along the way - see p.354 for details. To reach Cairo, you need a full 
Egyptian tourist visa (JD12), issued at airports and at land and sea borders, 
sometimes in US dollars only. JETT (T06 569 6151, Wwww.jett.com.jo) and 
their Egyptian partner SuperJet run buses twice weekly to the Almaza terminal 
at Heliopolis in Cairo; the fare (JD77) includes the Aqaba-Nuweiba ferry. It's 
advisable to book up to a week ahead. Other Abdali-based bus companies 
compete, all of them cheaper and even less comfortable. Royal Jordanian (T06
510 0000, Wwww.rj.com) and EgyptAir (T06 463 6011, Wwww.egyptair.com) 
fly several times daily to Cairo (1hr 30min; JD180 one-way).
Around the Middle East
JETT and other transport companies around Abdali run regular buses and 
serveeces direct to many other cities, including Homs, Hama and Aleppo; Beirut; 
Jeddah, Madina, Riyadh and Dammam; Kuwait; Baghdad; and points further 
afield in the Gulf, Turkey, Yemen and Libya. Middle Eastern airlines fly from 
Amman to their hub cities - including low-cost regional airlines Air Arabia 
(T06 560 3666, Wwww.airarabia.com), Fly Dubai (T06  550 7660, Wwww
.Flydubai.com) and Jazeera (T06 445 1576, Wwww.jazeeraairways.com), which 
have cut-price flights from Amman to Dubai or Sharjah. Other low-cost carriers 
serve cities in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.

The Dead Sea 
and around
B
arely a handful of kilometres west of Amman's city limits, the rugged 
highlands of central and northern Jordan drop away dramatically into 
the Dead Sea rift. This giant valley marks a geological dividing line as 
well as a political one, with the Arabian plate to the east shifting a few 
centimetres a year northwards, and the African plate to the west moving slowly 
southwards. Between the two is the River Jordan, defining Jordan's western 
border as it flows into the large, salty inland lake of the Dead Sea, famed as 
the lowest point on earth.
This whole area is within easy reach of the capital, and serves for many visitors 
as an alternative base - on the shore of the Dead Sea are ranged a number of 
world-class luxury hotels. It also works well as the source of some choice day-
trips. Taking a dip in the Dead Sea and relaxing on its salty beaches should form 
an unmissable part of anyone's itinerary, and you'll also find, in the rolling hills 
of the Balqa region that rise towards Amman, some low-key, little-visited small 
towns and villages, such as the graceful old Ottoman capital Salt and its 
neighbour Fuheis, that bring a refreshing change from the hustle and bustle of 
the big city.
The area's main historical draw is the most authoritative and best-documented 
candidate for the Baptism Site of Jesus, located on the east bank of the River 
Jordan about 8km north of the Dead Sea shore. The combination of archeology, 
the extraordinary natural environment and the momentous associations of the 
place mean that this is one of the Middle East's most important religious desti-
nations. Continuing the biblical theme, in the barren hills overlooking the 
southeastern part of the Dead Sea is Lot's Cave, where Abraham's nephew 
sought refuge from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.
The Dead Sea
Forming what has been called the world's biggest open-air spa, the amazing 
DEAD SEA (al-Bahr al-Mayit in Arabic) is a major highlight of a visit to the 
Middle East. Swimming in it is a memorable experience, quite unlike anything 
else on the planet.

THE DEAD SEA 
& AROUND 

131
The lake occupies the Great Rift Valley, a deep geological cleft which can be 
traced from Turkey all the way into East Africa. Its shoreline - at 400m below 
sea level - marks the lowest point on Earth, and is stiflingly hot for much of 
the year. 
The Dead Sea got its name in antiquity due to its uniquely salty water, which 
kills off virtually all marine life: seawater is about three or four percent salt, but 
Dead Sea water is over thirty percent. It is fed mainly by the River Jordan, 
flowing south from Galilee, but due to the geological upheavals it has no 
outflow; instead, water evaporates off the surface at the rate of millions of litres 
a day, leading to continuous precipitation of salt onto the beach and a thick 
atmospheric haze overhead which dampens sound down to almost nothing - 
there's little to hear but lapping water anyway. The haze also filters out harmful 
UVB sunrays, handily allowing tanning but not burning.
The major reason for a visit, though, is that the lake's high salinity makes the 
water so buoyant that it's literally impossible to sink; Olympic swimmers and 
The dying Dead Sea
The future of the Dead Sea is in doubt. In the 1950s, the lake's surface area was about 
a thousand square kilometres; today, it's less than seven hundred and still falling. The 
water level has already dropped by a startling 30m, and is continuing to fall by a metre 
a year. The problem is that greater and greater inroads have been made into the lake's 
freshwater sources: today, far more water evaporates from the lake than ﬂows into 
it. There are several dams across the River Jordan (as well as across its tributary, the 
Yarmouk), and - as part of its national water-conservation programme - Jordan has 
dammed all the major rivers in its territory that formerly ﬂowed directly into the Dead 
Sea, including the Zarqa Ma'in, the Mujib and the Hasa. In addition, both Israel and 
Jordan have developed major mineral and potash industries at the southern end of 
the lake which depend on large-scale evaporation for production.
Since the 1970s, Lynch's Strait, a channel of water which formerly connected the 
northern and southern parts of the lake, has dried out, turning the Lisan peninsula 
into a landbridge. Dangerous sinkholes are opening up in the soft ground on both 
shores. If things continue as they are, some estimates say the Dead Sea will dry up 
completely in ﬁfty years.
In 2002, the Israeli and Jordanian governments called for concerted action to save 
the Dead Sea. They launched a plan - with the Palestinian Authority - to build the 
so-called Red-Dead Canal, to bring seawater 250km from the Red Sea at Aqaba to 
replenish the Dead Sea. The 400m drop in altitude would mean that large quantities 
of hydroelectric power could be generated, and there would also be shared desalina-
tion plants creating up to 850 million cubic metres a year of potable water by reverse 
osmosis, thus substantially easing the region's critical shortage of water. The brine 
residue left after desalination would then be pumped into the Dead Sea to restore its 
natural water level. A feasibility study on the canal project is due to report soon after 
this book goes to press.
However, not everyone is happy. Friends of the Earth Middle East (Wwww.foeme
.org), a coalition of Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian environmental groups, has voiced 
several concerns - not least that it would take ten years to implement the Red-Dead 
plan whereas the Dead Sea needs immediate action. In addition, as it currently stands, 
the Red-Dead scheme allows the unplanned exploitation of the Dead Sea's resources 
to continue, with no bar on the numbers of hotels being built, and no imperative for 
sustainable development. There have, as yet, also been no detailed environmental 
studies on how the addition of huge quantities of seawater might affect the Dead 
Sea's delicate ecological balance - or on the possible impact of a pipeline breach in 
the open desert. Time will tell whether the Red-Dead Canal is the answer.

hopeless paddlers alike become bobbing corks. As you walk in, you'll find your 
feet are forced up from under you - you couldn't touch the bottom if you tried 
and if you lie back you'll find the water supports you like a cradle. You ride too 
high in the water to swim, and should you attempt a few strokes you'll find you 
just splash ineffectually and are likely to get water in your eyes, which is a very 
unpleasant experience. The salt will also make you very aware of every little cut 
and open blemish on your skin. Nonetheless, the sensation of floating 
completely unaided and silent on a flat, hot sea surrounded by hazy mountains 
is worth the discomfort.
Other diversions include covering yourself in the hot, sulphurous black mud
which collects in pools on the beach; letting it dry in the sun before washing it 
off will leave you with tingling muscles and baby-soft skin. However, scorching 
heat (well over 40°C in summer) and exceptionally low humidity make 
dehydration a real danger, and while you're out in the open you should be 
drinking twice or three times as much water as normal to compensate.
Many people come here for therapeutic tourism: both the waters and the 
mud have medically proven benefits, putting many severe skin diseases and joint 
problems into long-term remission. Calcium, magnesium, bromine, sulphur and 
bitumen - all with beneficial properties - are found in extremely high concentra-
tions, and, in addition, the air is very highly oxygenated, due to the combination 
of high rates of evaporation, high temperatures, high atmospheric pressure and 
low humidity. Celebrated skin-care products from the Dead Sea can be bought 
all over the country, and internationally. All the big hotels have medical centres, 
which are often booked solid for months ahead.
The Dead Sea is a popular spot for a weekend outing: roads, hotels and 
facilities can get crowded on Fridays and holidays. Bikinis and regular 
swimwear are fine at the hotel beaches and Amman Beach, but elsewhere a 
T-shirt and long shorts are a minimum. One thing to bear in mind, if you're 
planning a dip but want to avoid the big hotels, is that you should make sure 
you have access to a freshwater shower: Dead Sea brine is thick and oily, 
and leaves an uncomfortable layer of salt on your skin that you'll want to 
wash off before dressing.
Dead Sea hotels and beaches
At the end of the main highway down from Amman is a T-junction: the 
highway bends left towards the Dead Sea hotels, while a minor road heads right 
to the Baptism Site (see p.137). The old road to Jerusalem formerly led straight 
on at this junction, but the King Abdullah Bridge which carried it over the river 
was bombed in the 1967 war and never rebuilt; it has now been superseded by 
the King Hussein Bridge 8km upstream.
About 8km south of the T-junction, past a big conference centre and the Al-
Wadi Resort water park (Wwww.alwadiresort.com), is the luxury hotel zone, 
comprising a cluster of four- and five-star properties complete with pools, spas, 
showers, bathtubs, flushing toilets and a fairly extensive acreage of irrigated and 
hand-watered gardens, planted in what is naturally barren, salty soil. Almost all 
the fresh water for this hotel strip is piped from Wadi Mujib, which is severely 
depleted as a result. In such a desperately water-poor country, it's a moot point 
whether luxury development in this particularly arid spot is entirely a good 
thing. Nonetheless, more hotels and leisure complexes are planned: in addition 
to the properties listed below, expect - at least - a Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza 
and Swiss-Belhotel (2010) and an InterContinental (2012).
This zone at the lake's northeastern corner includes almost the only developed 
beaches along Jordan's shoreline, the remainder of which is mostly lined with 
THE DEAD SEA AND AROUND | The Dead Sea

133
jagged, salt-encrusted rocks. Hotels usually allow beach access to non-guests - 
expect a fee over JD15 - but may turn you away if they're particularly busy: 
phone ahead wherever possible. There are no towns or villages within easy 
reach, meaning that if you stay overnight your only entertainment options lie 
within your hotel (or you could stroll to the next-door hotel instead). Amman 
is about an hour's drive away; sites such as the Dead Sea Panorama (see p.134), 
Mount Nebo (p.231) and the Baptism Site (p.137) are closer at hand.
Dead Sea Mövenpick T05 356 1111, Wwww
.movenpick-deadsea.com. Outstanding choice 
with unusual taste and character. The lobby is 
supremely elegant - cooled by a ﬂowing artiﬁcial 
stream and waterfall - while the bar features a 
stunning wooden ceiling, hand-carved in 
Damascene style. Below the main buildings, the 
guest rooms are housed in two-storey buildings of 
local stone and plaster, superbly designed to 
imitate and blend in with the lumpy Dead Sea 
landscape of low, rounded marl hills; they're 
arranged around a succession of quiet, village-style 
courtyards featuring tinkling fountains and set 
among exotic ﬂower gardens, all with shaded 
balconies and full amenities. Further down the 
complex are a variety of restaurants - Italian, 
Asian, haute cuisine - plus a small amphitheatre 
for live music at sunset, a large open-air pool, and 
steps leading down to the beach. Off to one side is 
the ultra-chic spa (Wwww.zaraspa.com). 9
Dead Sea Spa Hotel T05 356 1000, Wwww
.jordandeadsea.com. Relatively modest four-star 
hotel that - compared with its ritzy neighbours - 
offers unusual value. It's especially good for day-
trippers or weekenders looking to avoid splurging 
at the big hotels, and was completely refurbished 
in 2008. Guest rooms are large and comfortable, 
and the on-site medical centre was the pioneer for 
therapeutic tourism in Jordan. 8
Jordan Valley Marriott T05 356 0400, 
Wwww.marriott.com/qmdjv. Excellent holiday 
hotel, built in a large U-shape around three 
swimming pools - including an inﬁnity pool 
facing west across the Dead Sea. Its public 
areas are spacious, airy and well designed, while 
the guest rooms are exceptional. Twelve cafés, 
bars and restaurants occupy several levels within 
the main reception building and seafront 
locations across the site, including outlets for 
Italian, Arabic, Asian and French brasserie-style 
cuisine. There are also diversions such as beach 
volleyball, a tennis court and live music at 
sunset, as well as an on-site spa and, of course, 
a beach. 9
Kempinski Ishtar Dead Sea T05 356 8888, 
Wwww.kempinski-deadsea.com. One of the Middle 
East's leading luxury hotels, breaking through the 
barrier of mere ﬁve stars. Set amid the gardens, 
lagoons and numerous palm-shaded pools are 
separate enclaves, including private villas and 
beach complexes, featuring cool designer interiors 
done up in a mock Babylonian style (Ishtar was the 
Babylonian goddess of love). The public areas are 
cool and airy, and many of the restaurants are 
recommendable, including the quirky, brightly 
colourful Obelisk designer eatery. The spa area is 
vast, including twenty treatment rooms alongside 
pools and steam rooms galore. 9
Amman Beach
Some 2km south of the hotel zone is the AMMAN BEACH resort (daily 
24hr; JD12). Don't be fooled by the name: Amman is about an hour away (and 
over 1200m up in the hills). At the time of writing, this is the Dead Sea's only 
public beach, and it's also the most easily accessible low-budget option for 
Dead Sea beach-bumming - not least because the main car park serves as the 
terminus for public buses from Amman and elsewhere. It's a well-run place with 
trees, plenty of shade and even patches of lawn; the entry ticket includes access 
to the beach and swimming pool. Spread around the site are facilities for 
children, including a play park and various beach games; an OK restaurant with 
buffet meals (around JD10); and good-quality beach facilities, including separate 
male and female changing areas, towel-rental and freshwater showers. You can 
also pitch a tent here (JD14).
Transport practicalities
The Dead Sea is easy to reach on a fast dual-lane road that branches off the 
Amman-Airport highway. With your own transport, it's easy to construct a 
THE DEAD SEA AND AROUND | The Dead Sea

134
circular day-trip route from either Amman or Madaba to take in the Baptism 
Site, the Dead Sea and Mount Nebo (see p.231).
Buses from Amman for the Dead Sea leave from Muhajireen station. Early-
morning buses (7-9am) run direct to "Amman Beach", but only if there's 
demand - guaranteed on a Friday. Others may stop short at the crossroads town 
of Shuneh al-Janubiyyeh (see p.143), about 15km north in the Jordan Valley. 
You can also reach Shuneh by bus from Salt, Dayr Alla and Madaba (via Mount 
Nebo). From Shuneh, frequent minibuses head to the village of Sweimeh, 3km 
northeast of the hotel zone; the driver might be willing to take you on to 
Amman Beach for a little extra.
The last bus back to Amman departs from Amman Beach at around 5pm, the 
last from Shuneh around 6pm (both an hour or two earlier in winter). If you 
miss these, a taxi from Amman Beach to Amman is about JD35, or you could 
pay JD5 for a taxi to the Rameh junction (at the foot of the climb to Amman) 
and then hitch.
South of Amman Beach, the Dead Sea road runs along the shoreline, eventu-
ally reaching Aqaba 278km away. This is a good, fast driving route with 
spectacular scenery that shifts from the deep blue of the Dead Sea to the sandy 
deserts of the Wadi Araba (see p.355).
Dead Sea Panorama
On the main road 5km south of Amman Beach is a marked turn-off climbing 
into the mountains: follow it up 9km of steep switchbacks to reach the 
DEAD SEA PANORAMA complex (daily 9am-5pm; winter closes 4pm; 
JD2; Wwww.rscn.org.jo). This sensitively designed building - managed by 
Jordan's Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) - perches on 
a cliff-edge with spectacular views over the Dead Sea: footpaths lead away 
from the parking area to viewpoints, and there's a short walking trail that 
covers a circular route around the site. Within the main building is the 
excellent Dead Sea Museum, covering four themes in fascinating detail: 
the geological origins of the Dead Sea, the ecology of the region, its arche-
ology and history, and issues surrounding future conservation. The museum 
is spacious, modern and air-conditioned: the exhibits and accompanying 
videos make for an absorbing visit. Next door is an RSCN nature shop, 
selling handmade crafts and jewellery.
The complex also includes a good A restaurant (daily noon-10.30pm; 
T05 349 1133 or 079 715 5584), a pleasant, upscale venue to sample high-
quality Arabic food in the air-conditioned interior or out on the terrace. 
Reckon on around JD20-25 a head for a fine selection of hot and cold mezze, 
salads, kebabs and grills; alcohol is served. It's a popular spot for weekend 
dining: book ahead.
From a T-junction just above the Panorama, a turn-off heads 2km to the 
luxury Six Senses spa resort at Hammamat Ma'in (see p.235), while the main 
road continues to climb to the plateau, passing through Ma'in village and 
ending after about 30km at Madaba (p.221).
South along the Dead Sea road
From the Panorama turn-off, it's another 7km south to a series of thermal 
springs at Zara, lying downstream from the hot waterfalls of Hammamat Ma'in 
(see p.235). Zara is a very popular Friday outing spot, with cars lined up along 
the highway, and people alternating between dipping in the Dead Sea and 
THE DEAD SEA AND AROUND | The Dead Sea

washing the salt off in the warm spring water. Men can splash around freely but 
even in the secluded valleys women should only venture in fully clothed. A few 
hundred metres south of Zara are the remains of King Herod's baths and Dead 
Sea port at Callirhoë, although there's little left to see other than a handful of 
column drums and the remnants of a harbour wall.
Mujib Nature Reserve
The Dead Sea road continues to the Mujib Bridge, 27km south of Amman 
Beach, a graceful 140-metre construction crossing the outflow of the River 
Mujib; on the lake side of the bridge you can splash around in the refreshing 
river water. The valley system, which extends high into the mountains, is the 
centrepiece of the MUJIB NATURE RESERVE (for more, see p.241; 
Wwww.rscn.org.jo). Below the bridge, on the cliff side of the road, is the 
visitor centre (daily 8am-4pm; T077 742 2125). Staff here have maps, 
brochures and light refreshments, and can advise on walking routes, though you 
should always book in advance directly or through the RSCN's "Wild 
Jordan" centre in Amman (see p.51). The easy - but memorably dramatic - Siq
Trail (April-Oct only; JD1pp self-guided; JD12pp with guide; 2.5hr) heads into 
the Mujib gorge, leading you between towering sandstone cliffs to the base of 
a waterfall before returning; you may be wading or even swimming some 
sections. A tougher alternative is the Ibex Trail (year-round; JD20pp; guide 
compulsory; 4hr), which heads from the Mujib Bridge south to a steep access 
route up into the mountains, traversing a number of dry valleys on the way to 
a ranger station: you may spot ibex roaming wild here. The Malaqi Trail
(April-Oct only; JD55pp; guide compulsory; 7-9hr) is a classic canyoning route, 
graded difficult, which initially follows the Ibex Trail before descending into the 
Mujib gorge and heading upstream to the confluence with the Wadi Hidan, 
then returning - via a 20m waterfall abseil - to the Mujib Bridge. These and 
other walks that start from the reserve's eastern highland entrance at Faqua (see 
p.241) are outlined on the website. All routes are closed during Ramadan.
On the Mujib river delta nearby stands a cluster of modest A chalets (T079
720 3888, Wwww.rscn.org.jo; 6) that are compact and simple but still comfort-
able. Each is air-conditioned but not en suite - the communal shower and toilet 
block is separate - and comes with its own shaded terrace looking north over 
a quiet beach that is pleasant for a float (and has showers). They are open year-
round, but even the staff admit that the air conditioning isn't enough to ease the 
blistering temperatures of high summer (June-Aug). Alongside is a pleasant 
restaurant block offering meals (JD6-15) and lunchboxes - though only with 
advance booking. Access isn't easy: until a sealed road has been laid, check in 
first at the Mujib Bridge visitor centre, from where staff will drive you over to 
the chalets in their 4x4.
THE DEAD SEA AND AROUND | The Dead Sea
Prices at Jordan's RSCN-run nature reserves are high. The RSCN makes no 
apologies for this: it says that the reason it exists is to protect Jordan's natural 
environment, and that it has built lodges and developed tourism as a tool for gener-
ating funds to help conservation and support rural communities. You may or may 
not agree with their pricing policy - but this kind of responsible tourism is virtually 
unknown in the Middle East, and the RSCN are pioneers. For now, until tourism 
schemes emerge that are truly community-owned, paying extra to visit the RSCN 
reserves is a good way to ensure that your money goes to beneﬁt rural people 
and habitats.

136
Bab adh-Dhraa
The road continues south alongside the Dead Sea, hugging the salt-spattered 
shore below rocky cliffs. Some 24km south of Mujib is MAZRA'A, a small 
town on the Lisan Peninsula - now a belt of dry land across the lake. 
Exploring the peninsula isn't encouraged by the Arab Potash Company, but it's 
still possible to turn off at the company's sign, drive out a little way and then 
venture into the soft white sand on foot. You might stumble upon one of the 
old Byzantine monasteries that lie ruined here, unexcavated, in an eerie 
landscape forever sultry and thick with haze.
About 1km south of Mazra'a is a turn-off leading up into the hills to 
Karak (see p.242). Take this road for about 1km and you'll come to the 
Bronze Age tell of Bab adh-Dhraa, rising on your left. It's a sparse site, 
offering a thick city wall and a handful of foundations: the attraction is in 
relating the place to a name. Bab adh-Dhraa is the site of a large town which 
flourished around 2600 BC - some graves in the huge necropolis across the 
road date from as early as the fourth millennium - and is the leading 
candidate for biblical Sodom, location of so much depravity that God felt 
compelled to raze the city and kill its inhabitants. Standing on the tell today, 
amid barren rocks on the hazy shores of a salt lake, you can only wonder 
what on earth the poor Sodomites must have been up to in these rooms to 
deserve such a fate.
Sodom and Gomorrah
The tale in Genesis of how God punished the depravity of the inhabitants of 
Sodom and Gomorrah, and how Lot and his wife escaped, is one of the best-
known biblical stories. After arriving in Canaan (Palestine), Lot and his uncle 
Abraham began to bicker over grazing grounds. They separated, and Lot pitched 
his tents at the southeastern corner of the Dead Sea near Sodom, one of the ﬁve 
"cities of the plain" (the others were Gomorrah, Zoar, Admah and Zeboyim). "But," 
as Genesis warns, "the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord 
exceedingly." One evening, Lot was visited by two angels, come to warn him of 
the city's impending divine destruction. Lot, his wife and two daughters ﬂed and 
"the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and ﬁre." Every one of the 
ﬁve cities was destroyed, and every person killed. As they were ﬂeeing, Lot's wife 
disobeyed a divine order not to look back at the destruction, and was turned into 
a pillar of salt.
Seemingly the last people left alive in the world, Lot and his daughters sought 
refuge in a cave in the mountains. Calculating that, with all potential mates vaporized, 
they were likely to die childless, the daughters hatched a plan to get their father so 
drunk he wouldn't be able to tell who they were, whereupon they would seduce him 
and thus preserve the family. Everything worked to plan and both daughters gave 
birth to sons; the elder named her child Moab, and the younger Ben-Ammi, or "father 
of Ammon".
The last of these bizarre biblical episodes has been commemorated for centuries, 
and possibly millennia, at a cave-and-church complex in the hills above Saﬁ. Ruins 
within Saﬁ itself, as well as at four other scanty Early Bronze Age sites nearby (Bab 
adh-Dhraa, Numayra, Fifa and Khanazir), show evidence of destruction by ﬁre. At 
Numayra, archeologists also found the skeletons of three men whose bones were 
crushed by falling masonry. These ﬁve could possibly be the "cities of the plain". The 
only ﬂy in the ointment is that they were razed around 2350 BC, several hundred 
years before the generally accepted era of Abraham and Lot, although archeologists 
are still debating the precise timescales involved.
THE DEAD SEA AND AROUND | The Dead Sea

137
Lot's Cave and Museum
Some 22km south of the Karak turning on the Dead Sea road, a sign points left 
to Lot's Cave - a rich archeological site that has thrown up evidence of Early 
and Middle Bronze Age habitation, as well as Nabatean pottery, Byzantine 
mosaics and the earliest example of carved wood yet discovered intact in Jordan: 
a door that dates from the seventh century Umayyad period. The location - not 
to mention the notion of standing in Lot's sandalprints - is dramatic enough to 
warrant a visit.
About 1km along this turn-off you'll spot Lot's Museum - a grand, semicir-
cular building designed to showcase the historical heritage of the Jordan Valley/
Dead Sea area. It was due to open in 2009, soon after this book went to press.
From the museum, a track continues steeply up the hill to a parking area at 
the foot of steps leading up to the cave itself. The guardian will accompany you 
up to the site, which involves a tiring climb of almost 300 steps. The Ministry 
of Tourism are in the process of constructing a shelter over the site; it may be 
complete by the time you visit.
The first area you come to is a court, part of which has slipped down the 
hill, but which originally served to support the floor of the church above. 
The main apse has seating for the bishop and is slightly raised. Five mosaics
- one dated April 606, another May 691 - have been renovated, and will be 
uncovered for viewing once the site shelter is complete. The narthex was 
originally entered from the right, via a doorway from the court below; this 
ingenious piece of design enabled visiting Jewish and Muslim pilgrims to 
avoid stepping inside the church and instead head straight for the holy cave, 
the entrance to which is to the left of the apse. A beautifully carved lintel over 
the cave entrance, marked with crosses, presages an interior mosaic which 
mimics the round stones embedded in the roof. All around the church was 
spread a monastery, and the remains of six or seven isolated cells are dotted 
around the parched hillside. The views from the church over the Dead Sea 
and the nearby town of Safi are stunning.
Saﬁ and beyond
SAFI, at the southern tip of the Dead Sea, is the phosphate capital of Jordan, 
although - under the name Zoar - it also has a history as one of the five biblical 
"cities of the plain", along with Sodom and Gomorrah. The southernmost 
portion of the Dead Sea has been corralled into huge evaporation pans for 
Jordan's phosphate and chemical industries and, with its neighbour, the lush 
farming village of FIFA a bit further south, Safi shares a natural hothouse that 
is one of the most intensively farmed areas of Jordan, with bananas, tomatoes 
and other fruits as staple irrigated crops.
Just beyond Fifa, a scenic turn-off climbs to Tafileh (see p.249), while contin-
uing south brings you into the long Wadi Araba, with drifting sand and 
wandering camels all the way south to Aqaba. See p.355 for more on this route.
Bethany: the Baptism Site
One of the most important recent discoveries in Middle Eastern archeology has 
been the identification of a site on the east bank of the River Jordan, near the 
Dead Sea, as Bethany-beyond-the-Jordan, the place where John the Baptist 
lived, and where he most likely baptized Jesus Christ. Archeologists have 
uncovered a wealth of sites - 21 at the last count - along Wadi Kharrar, a small 
THE DEAD SEA AND AROUND | Bethany: the Baptism Site

138
side-valley of reeds and flowing water that runs for 2km from its source down 
to the River Jordan. These discoveries - eleven Byzantine churches, five 
baptismal pools from the Roman and Byzantine periods, caves of monks and 
hermits, and lodges for pilgrims - plus a wealth of medieval accounts of 
pilgrims and travellers to the area, rapidly convinced both Jordanian and inter-
national opinion as to the veracity of the site.
This is almost the lowest point on earth, over 350m below sea level; the air is 
thick, hot and heavy. On the banks of the Wadi Kharrar, you're in the midst of 
the biblical Plains of Moab; views across the baked ground, punctuated by the 
occasional wizened tree, enable you to pick out individual buildings and cars in 
Jericho. Underfoot is a soft, chalky marl that seems to deaden sound; only when 
you get close to Wadi Kharrar itself can you hear the chirping of birds and the 
soughing of the dense beds of reeds and tamarisk that line the watercourse. 
Flanking the River Jordan itself is a jungle-like thicket, tropically hot and humid 
- more akin to Southeast than Southwest Asia.
Visiting outside winter (Nov-Feb) means that you'll have to cope with 
scorching temperatures, often topping 45°C in summer. The best advice is to 
arrive at 8am and explore in the relative cool of the morning. But don't let this

THE DEAD SEA AND AROUND | Bethany: the Baptism Site

put you off; for its historical resonance, natural austerity and religious power, 
this is an extraordinary place.
Some history
This stretch of desolate plain flanking the River Jordan has been a focus for 
spirituality since Old Testament times: Judaism, Christianity and Islam all recall 
momentous events which took place in this relatively small part of the southern 
Jordan Valley. First mention is in Genesis, when Lot separated from Abraham 
and "chose the plain of Jordan" to pitch his tents, after which Jacob wrestled 
with God a little way north at Penuel. A sizeable proportion of the Book of 
Numbers is set at the Israelites' camp, "pitched in the plains of Moab by Jordan 
opposite Jericho", following which Moses delivers a long summation in 
Deuteronomy before going up "from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of 
Nebo", where he died. Joshua led the tribes across the river, which miracu-
lously halted its flow, an event mirrored centuries later in 2 Kings, when the 
prophets Elijah and Elisha again stopped the flow of the river, as a chariot and 
horses of fire took Elijah up to heaven - according to ancient tradition, from 
the rounded hillock alongside Wadi Kharrar now known as Tell Mar Elyas 
(Elijah's Hill).
It was because of the associations with the prophet Elijah that, a thousand 
years later, John, an ascetic holy man with a prophetic vision, took up 
residence near the same hillock, using the numerous small springs of sweet 
water to symbolically cleanse people of sin; locals soon flocked to this John 
the Baptist. Most biblical mentions describe the baptisms taking place "in 
Jordan", which probably referred loosely to this general area. The River 
Jordan, which often flooded to a width of 1km or more, would have been 
rapid (in Aramaic, yardeen - from which "Jordan" is derived - means "fast-
flowing water") and deep, offering no easy access from the often steep bank. 
By contrast, the dozens of tiny side-springs, some of which rise within 
 The Greek Orthodox Church of St John, Baptism Site
THE DEAD SEA AND AROUND | Bethany: the Baptism Site

140
pools barely 100m from the river, are protected and more manageable as 
immersion points.
The Gospel of St John mentions "Bethany-beyond-the-Jordan, where 
John was baptizing"; the spot - unconnected with Bethany near Jerusalem - 
was also known as Bethabara or Beit-Abara, "the House of the Crossing-Point". 
A later account says that Jesus "returned again across the Jordan to the place 
where John had first started baptizing". There is no explicit mention of when 
or where John baptized Jesus, but the accumulated weight of tradition and 
historical evidence places it in or near Wadi Kharrar, within easy reach of 
plentiful supplies of spring water, alongside the Roman road between Jericho 
and Nebo (thereby within easy reach of potential converts), but far enough out 
of reach to mean that John could criticize King Herod with impunity.
As early as 333 AD, the anonymous Pilgrim of Bordeaux identified the site 
of Bethany-beyond-the-Jordan as lying five Roman miles (just under 7.5km) 
north of the Dead Sea, corresponding almost exactly to the point where the 
Wadi Kharrar enters the river: "here is a place by the river, a little hill on the far 
bank, where Elijah was caught up into heaven". From then on, many ancient 
texts mention several churches in the same area dedicated to John the Baptist 
and Elijah. The sixth-century pilgrim Theodosius described the riverside 
"Church of St John, which the emperor Anastasius built [in about 500 AD]; this 
church is very lofty, being built above chambers on account of the flooding of 
the Jordan" - a description which corresponds almost exactly with one of the 
churches uncovered recently. Other pilgrims at this time talked of the whole 
valley being "full of hermits". The place was important enough to merit 
inclusion on the Madaba mosaic map (see p.226).
The accounts continued through the Middle Ages, with Bethany-beyond-the-
Jordan taking its place in a pilgrimage route linking Jerusalem, Jericho, Hesban 
and Mount Nebo. From the twelfth to the eighteenth century, Bethany was home 
to Greek Orthodox monks, who were reported still to be present as late as the 
turn of the twentieth century (the whole site is still in the custody of the Greek 
Orthodox Church), but most ruins lay undiscovered while knowledge of the 
whereabouts of Bethany-beyond-the-Jordan faded from collective memory.
Archeological investigations at Tell Mar Elias and along Wadi Kharrar had to 
be abandoned at the outbreak of war in 1948, and for many years the site lay 
in a militarized border zone. It was only after the 1994 peace treaty between 
Jordan and Israel that the area could be swept for landmines and again opened 
for study. The momentous discoveries that rapidly followed convinced the 
Jordanian authorities, and then the broad mass of specialist opinion worldwide, 
that the long-lost "Bethany-beyond-the-Jordan" had been rediscovered.
Practicalities
The site (daily 8am-6pm; winter closes 4pm; last entry 1hr before closing; JD7; 
Wwww.baptismsite.com) is signposted from the T-junction at the end of the 
highway down from Amman. The highway bends left (south) to the Dead Sea 
hotels, while to the right (north) is a minor road to the Baptism Site. Note that 
if you're approaching from the Dead Sea hotels, you have to follow the highway 
round to the right and then make a U-turn in order to get onto the Baptism 
Site road.
From the junction, it's 5km to a gateway across the road, where you pay the 
admission fee and receive a free brochure (with a map). A little ahead is the 
parking area in front of the palm-shaded Visitors' Centre, which has toilets, 
souvenir shops and refreshment kiosks, and which is where the official site 
guides wait. If you're visiting independently in a car (or privately hired taxi), 
THE DEAD SEA AND AROUND | Bethany: the Baptism Site

141
an official site guide (free with entry ticket) can accompany you, in your own 
vehicle, for a tour around the site. Private vehicles without a site guide are 
banned within the site. Otherwise, you must wait at the Visitors' Centre for a 
free shuttle bus (every 15-20min), which makes a round trip to the three 
separate areas of the site. Allow a minimum visit of one hour - though an in-
depth tour of the whole site could take up to three hours.
Tell Mar Elyas (Elijah's Hill) is alongside Parking 1; the Baptism Pools and 
pilgrims' station are by Parking 2; and John the Baptist's Church down by the 
River Jordan is a short walk from Parking 3. Fresh drinking water is provided 
at several points (but you should ideally carry your own), and there are toilets 
at Parking 3, as well as at the Visitors' Centre. You can also - with advance notice 
- elect to tackle the hot and tiring walk from the Visitors' Centre to Tell Mar 
Elyas and onwards on a marked trail along the south bank of the Wadi Kharrar 
to John's Church and the River Jordan. It's about 4km in total, but allow three 
hours one way.
Note that the pools and springs are mostly or completely dry from late May 
until late October.
Along Wadi Kharrar
The site comprises six square kilometres focused around the small Wadi 
Kharrar, which runs westwards for 2km on a meandering course from beside 
the rounded hillock of Tell Mar Elyas down to join the River Jordan amid 
fourteen small springs around the Church of John the Baptist. Midway along 
is a set of ancient baptism pools.
Tell Mar Elyas (Elijah's Hill)
At the head of the little Wadi Kharrar, alongside Parking 1, stands the low Tell 
Mar Elyas. A few metres south of the tell, a number of remains have been 
uncovered. The most prominent sight is a large freestanding arch, raised in 1999 
from 63 stones (to commemorate the death at 63 of King Hussein) over the 
foundations of a rectangular church dating from the fourth or fifth century. 
Since March 21, 2000, when the then pope celebrated Mass beneath this arch 
and, in a gesture of reconciliation, faced west to bless Jerusalem then east to bless 
Mount Nebo, the site has been known as the Church of John Paul II. A few 
metres away are the foundations of a larger rectangular building, with some 
fragments of a mosaic floor remaining, that has been dubbed a prayer hall. 
A proliferation of churches
In recent years many new churches have been built at the Baptism Site, as the 
world's Christian denominations clamour to be represented at this hugely important 
site. The planning process is strict, and all the new buildings are modest and unintru-
sive - many rather beautiful. By the time you visit there will be - or are planned - 
Coptic, Armenian, Ethiopian, Syrian Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, 
Anglican, Lutheran and Baptist churches, along with other institutions and prayer 
centres, as well as monasteries and/or pilgrim hostels belonging to the Greek 
Orthodox, Latin and Russian Orthodox churches.
If you're here to afﬁrm your Christian faith, you can request to be taken for a private 
religious ceremony at any of several baptism pools and centres around the site. 
Someone from your own party can ofﬁciate or you can ask for a local priest to 
conduct the ceremony. Contact T077 760 7036 or Epromotionunit@baptismsite
.com several weeks in advance.
THE DEAD SEA AND AROUND | Bethany: the Baptism Site

142
Around here is a complicated web of water channels, pool-beds, a pear-shaped 
well (once circular, but distorted by earth movements) and a large cistern, still 
with its plastered interior, that formerly was covered by a barrel vault of 
sandstone quarried 20km away at Sweimeh topped with a mosaic floor 
(remnants of which have been preserved). With the level of settlement in 
antiquity, and the numbers of baptisms performed here, a great deal of water was 
needed: pipes and aqueducts channelled water to the site from several kilome-
tres away, but still the 100-cubic-metre cistern wasn't enough, and a second, 
smaller cistern was built nearby.
The small tell features a trinity of trinities - three churches, three caves and three 
baptism pools - encircled by a wooden catwalk. Proceeding clockwise, on the west 
side of the tell is a cave which forms the apse of a small Byzantine church, with 
small niches to the east and south and tiny fragments of its mosaic floor. An open 
chapel on the northwest side leads round to the large, late-Byzantine northern 
church, now sheltered from the elements, which incorporates a strange black 
stone into its apse to commemorate the fire which accompanied Elijah's rise to 
heaven. Its detailed mosaic floor includes an intriguing cross motif in diamonds and 
an inscription in Greek which dates it to "the time of Rhotorius" (early sixth 
century). Up a couple of steps on the northeastern side of the tell are two pools
from the Roman period, one cut later with the addition of a fourteen-metre-deep 
well. Further round is a large rectangular pool, plastered, and with a line of four 
steps leading into it - for group baptisms, it's been suggested.
The Pilgrims' Station, Baptism Pool and caves
Paths lead down from the tell area to the footpath along the south side of Wadi 
Kharrar, which features several sites attesting to the faith of Byzantine pilgrims 
and ascetics. Around 500m west of the tell are the remains of a lavra, a complex 
of hermits' cells, while further west - near Parking 2 - is a large Baptism
Pool, designed to hold 300 people, built roughly on its lower courses but with 
well-dressed sandstone ashlars further up. Channels fed spring water to the pool; 
a fifth- or sixth-century building excavated on a small promontory directly 
above the pool, with views over the whole valley, may well have been a hostel 
for visiting pilgrims (it has now been dubbed the Pilgrims' Station).
Immediately to the west, the ghor, or broad valley floor, gives way to the zor, 
or narrow, deep-set flood-plain flanking the River Jordan itself. Cut into the 
loose marl of these cliffs, and now accessible by modern steps, are two caves, 
each featuring prayer niches; one of the caves has three interior apses. The 
seventh-century writer John Moschus records the pilgrimage to Sinai of a 
monk John, from Jerusalem; while recovering from a fever in the lavra of 
Safsafas, John the Baptist appeared to him and said, "This little cave is greater 
than Mount Sinai: our Lord Jesus Christ himself visited me here."
Church of John the Baptist
The Old Testament prophet Jeremiah spoke of the "jungle of the Jordan", and 
the contrast in the natural environment between Tell Mar Elyas and the churches 
on the banks of the Jordan itself couldn't be stronger. This narrow strip flanking 
the river is quite unlike anywhere else in the country: paths from the wild and 
knobbly lunar landscape of the desert-like zor around Parking 3 plunge into a 
wall of woody tamarisk bushes so thick that, had a way not been cut, it would 
be impossible to force your way through. Inside the thicket of reeds and tamarisk, 
the air is steamy and tropical, full of the chirruping of birds and the hum of 
insects, and marked by a constant babble of water from the fourteen springs that 
flow all around (indeed, the name "Kharrar" is thought to be onomatopoeic).
THE DEAD SEA AND AROUND | Bethany: the Baptism Site

143
A five- or ten-minute walk through the "jungle" - past a number of springs 
and rest areas - brings you to a clearing marked by a modern pool and the 
sheltered remains of the sixth- or seventh-century Church of John the 
Baptist, situated alongside two more churches, which were built more or less on 
top of one another; the floor of the lower one, tiled in triangular, square and 
octagonal flags of marble, has been exposed, and there are also marble Corinthian 
capitals from long-fallen columns lying nearby. Beneath a shelter is the altar and 
mosaic floor of the main church, which was formerly raised up above the level 
of the river on an arched vault to protect it from flooding - exactly as medieval 
pilgrims recorded. Pillars from this vault still lie where they fell in antiquity, on 
the north side of the church building. Byzantine stairs, three of them black 
marble or bitumen, interspersed with white marble from Asia Minor, lead from 
the apse to what is still known as the Spring of John the Baptist. A marble 
fragment commemoratively marked "IOY. BATT." (a Latin abbreviation of "John 
the Baptist") that was found in the church is on display in the Visitors' Centre.
The River Jordan
About 200m west of the ancient church, via a laid path through the tamarisks, 
stands the modern Greek Orthodox Church of St John, alongside other 
churches (see box, p.141). Opposite, shaded steps lead down to a wooden 
platform on the River Jordan itself - not the grand, Amazon-like spectacle of 
imagination, but rather a low, muddy stream, these days barely a metre deep and 
less than 10m wide at this point. On the opposite bank, in Israeli-occupied 
territory, is a complex known as Qasr al-Yahud - a white stone terrace, 
complete with chapel, that lacks any historical or religious authenticity. (Alter-
native Israeli baptism sites further north are unashamedly commercial affairs, 
where "pilgrims" pay to be dipped in the river.)
Linger here awhile, if you can: despite its modest appearance these days, the 
Jordan is one of the world's great rivers, with huge religious and historical 
significance. There are very few other places along its course where you can get 
this close to the water - and none has such drama.
The walk back to Parking 3 leads you on a different route via two more river 
lookouts, perched high above the banks.
The southern Jordan Valley
North of the Baptism Site extends the long, hot Jordan Valley; for more, see 
p.181. The main settlement in these southern stretches, among the farming 
villages of the valley floor, is the crossroads market town of SHUNEH
AL-JANUBIYYEH (South Shuneh), served by buses running south to the 
Dead Sea and into the hills to Mount Nebo and Madaba, north along the 
Jordan Valley road to Dayr Alla (see below), and east to Salt and Amman; taxis 
do the short run west to the King Hussein Bridge crossing-point.
North of Shuneh, the Jordan Valley road cuts a straight path through simple 
villages and past swathes of farmland. Points of interest are few and far between 
down here: the culture is all rural and agricultural and the archeological 
King Hussein/Allenby Bridge
Turn to p.35 for information about arriving in Jordan via the King Hussein/Allenby 
Bridge, and p.123 for details of transport to the bridge from Amman.
THE DEAD SEA AND AROUND | The southern Jordan Valley

144
sites - though plentiful - are strictly for scholars: barely one stone stands upon 
another in any of them.
A few kilometres beyond Shuneh lies the humdrum town of Karameh, site 
of a major dam; 16km north is an old road sign pointing west to the Palestinian 
city of Nablus, harking back to the days before 1967 when territory on both 
sides of the river was Jordanian (the turn-off leads to a bridge now reserved for 
agricultural traffic).
Dayr Alla and around
Some 26km north of Karameh is the market town of DAYR ALLA, served by 
buses from Amman, Salt and valley destinations. Rising beside the road about 
1km north of the town - whose name translates as "High Monastery" and has 
nothing to do with Allah or Islam - is the large Tell Dayr Alla. Some historians 
link this site with biblical Penuel, where Jacob wrestled with God; others 
associate it with Succoth, site of an ironworks that produced pieces used in the 
Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. One excavation uncovered an inscription in 
red and black ink on plaster, dated around 800 BC, relating tales of prophecy by 
Balaam, a seer mentioned in the Bible (Numbers 22-24). Heading down the 
street that hugs the south flank of the tell brings you to an office; as well as 
providing information and impromptu refreshment, staff can unlock the small 
museum (daily except Fri 8am-1pm & 2-5pm; free), which houses a collection 
of interesting bits and bobs from sites throughout the valley as well as an explana-
tion of the Balaam text. The tell itself, punctured by deep excavation trenches 
exposing anonymous walls and rooms, is barely worth the effort of the climb.
Around 9km north of Dayr Alla is the town of Kraymeh, served by buses 
from Ajloun as well as the valley villages north and south. Just before the town, 
opposite an isolated mosque with a stone minaret, a road branches west towards 
the huge mound of Tell as-Sa'idiyyeh, some 2km away, home to a large city 
in the Late Bronze Age, during the thirteenth and twelfth centuries BC. 
Halfway along the right-hand slope of the tell, a reconstructed Iron Age stone
staircase leads up from a spring-fed pool to the summit; excavation trenches 
display remnants of an Egyptian-style public building (Sa'idiyyeh may have 
been a northern outpost of the Egyptian empire) and city wall. The tell gives 
stunning views along the length of the valley, though the River Jordan itself, 
only a few hundred metres away, is still invisible in its gorge.
North of here, buses follow the valley road for 20km or so to the town of 
Mshare'a, access point for the ancient site of Pella (see p.182).
Turn to p.181 for coverage of the northern part of the Jordan Valley.
THE DEAD SEA AND AROUND | The Balqa hills
The Balqa hills
The gentle hills which roll westward from Amman down to the Jordan Valley 
through the historic Balqa region - of which the graceful old town of Salt is
capital - are laced with lush, beautiful valleys and dotted with pleasant towns 
such as Wadi Seer and Fuheis, the latter with an appealing little crafts quarter. 
Near Wadi Seer is one of the few examples of Hellenistic architecture surviving 
in the Middle East - the impressive white palace of Qasr al-Abd, set in open 
countryside near an ancient cave system known as Iraq al-Amir. All these 
places are easily accessible by bus from Amman, and could together form an 
unusual half- or full-day trip by car.

145
Salt
For many centuries, SALT was the only settlement of any size in Trans-
jordan. A regional capital under the Ottomans, the town - whose name 
derives from the ancient Greek saltos, meaning "thick forest" - came into 
its own in the late nineteenth century, when merchants from Nablus 
arrived to expand their trading base east of the river. Into what was then 
a peasant village of shacks boxed between precipitous hills, the merchants 
brought sophisticated architects and masons to work with the honey-
coloured local limestone; buildings were put up in the ornate Nabulsi 
style to serve both as grand residences and as merchandise centres. With 
open trade to and from Palestine, Salt's boom continued into the 1920s; 
the new Emirate of Transjordan was formally proclaimed in 1921 in 
the town's main square, but by then the railway from Damascus had reached 
nearby Amman and Emir Abdullah chose the better-connected town to be his 
 Street scene, Salt

146
capital. As quickly as Salt had flourished, it went into decline: superseded by 
Amman, it was cut off by war in 1948 from its traditional trade outlet to the 
Mediterranean at Haifa, then again in 1967 from its Palestinian twin, Nablus. 
As a consequence, Salt has seen none of the headlong modernization that has 
afflicted the capital: much of the Ottoman architecture in the old quarter has 
survived, as has peace and quiet, perfect for aimless exploration. A city-wide 
renovation project has been running for several years, upgrading the old mansions 
and creating an infrastructure for tourism. You may find things have moved on by 
the time you visit.
The Town
Standing under the huge eucalyptus at the road junction a short walk up from the 
bus station, you are surrounded by three towering hills: to your right are the bare 
rocky slopes of as-Salalem, to the left rises the tree-adorned peak of al-Jada'a, 
and straight ahead is al-Qal'a, named for the Mamluke fortress on its summit 
which was demolished in 1840 and finally swept away recently for a white-domed 
mosque. Walking a little way along Maydan Street, you'll spot the arched and 
pillared facade of the modern Salt Archeological Museum (Sat-Thurs 
8am-7pm, Fri 9am-4pm; winter closes earlier; JD2; Wjordan.nlembassy.org
/culture), housing a fascinating collection that includes a working model of a 
Mamluke sugar mill and an impression of a Neolithic dolmen landscape. The 
Ottoman-era building is equally interesting, known as Beit Touqan, once the stately 
residence of the Touqan family (King Hussein's third wife, Queen Alia, was a

Touqan). A few café tables in the enchanting upper courtyard entice you to linger.
Turning left at the Arab Bank a few minutes further along Maydan Street leads 
you into narrow Hammam Street (the eponymous hammam was razed in the 
1930s for lack of customers). This lane, known as Souk al-Hammam, is lined 
with buildings - including a wonderful old mosque - which date from Salt's 
golden age and hosts what is Jordan's oldest souk, an ordinary market of food 
and household goods that nonetheless is full of atmosphere.
Hammam Street emerges at the Seyaaha, Salt's main plaza, dominated on one 
side by the graceful arched facade of the Abu Jaber mansion, newly renovated 
home of the Historic Old Salt Museum - due to open after this book went to 
press, and billed as offering walking tours around the old quarter to view more 
rejuvenated town houses. Bending sharply to the right is tiny Khadir Street, 
with several flights of steps leading steeply up the hill. Partway up you'll see the 
colonnaded honey-stone English Hospital, its gates still bearing an "EH" 
monogram; the building is now the Middle East's first vocational training centre 
for people with disabilities. The view from the summit, bathed in sunshine, out 
over the town to the rolling Balqa hills beyond, is worth the hard climb.
Practicalities
Buses run to Salt from both Tabarbour and Mahatta stations in Amman, as well 
as from the flyover at Sweileh (the same pick-up point as for buses to Fuheis - see 
below). Meagre information about the town can be had from the Department 
of Antiquities office (T05 355 5651) at the museum. For refreshment while 
wandering, there are a few coffee houses dotted around; one of the best spreads 
itself over Dayr Street next to the white-domed mosque close to the museum. 
Restaurants are exclusively in the spit-and-sawdust category, and king among 
them is al-Ammad, which has been churning out quality shish-kebabs to the Salti 
cognoscenti for a century or more. It's on Amaneh Street, nine doors up from the 
Cairo Amman Bank, with no sign in English or Arabic; spot it by the small plaque 
beside the door which outlines its history (in English).
If you're heading for the Jordan Valley, it's worth knowing that the road from Salt 
down to Shuneh al-Janubiyyeh follows the beautiful and dramatic Wadi Shuayb, 
a perpetually flowing stream lush with undergrowth all year and carpeted with 
wildflowers in spring; this is a much more impressive route down to the valley 
floor than the highway from Amman. North of Salt, on the Dayr Alla road, the 
Zai National Park is perfect picnic territory, thick forest with rough trails and 
plenty of wild nooks.
Pigeon-fancying
At sunset in towns all across Jordan, you'll see small, tight ﬂocks of pigeons wheeling 
overhead. Pigeon-fancying is surprisingly popular, and has taken on something of a 
shady image, since the point of it is not to race the birds, but rather to kidnap prize 
specimens from other people's ﬂocks. In every neighbourhood, as the sun goes 
down, people emerge onto the ﬂat rooftops and open up their ramshackle pigeon 
coops, sometimes twirling a lure on a length of rope to keep the ﬂock dipping and 
swooping, sometimes holding a female bird up so that the males will circle around. 
Neighbours will often deliberately exercise their ﬂocks at the same time, to try and 
persuade each other's birds to defect; similarly, some well-trained ﬂocks can be 
enticed to ﬂy off to another part of town to bring back new individuals. Newspapers 
report that enthusiasts gain three or four new birds a week, yet lose roughly the same 
number. Many fanciers keep their identities secret, since - for obvious reasons - 
they're popularly seen as being not entirely trustworthy.
THE DEAD SEA AND AROUND | The Balqa hills

148
Fuheis
Set among rolling hills near Salt - and just 15km northwest of Amman - 
FUHEIS (pronounced "f-hayce") is a prosperous but rarely visited small town 
with a delightful, partially restored old quarter of rooftop restaurants and sleepy 
craft shops. The town is 95 percent Christian and boasts at least five churches, 
three of which date back to the nineteenth century. Its easy-going atmosphere 
- and, in summer, the best peaches in Jordan - makes Fuheis a pleasant place to 
spend an afternoon.
The town has two distinct halves. The first, known as al-Allali (with a large 
calligraphic sculpture in the central Shakr roundabout), is newer and less attrac-
tive; make sure you carry on down the steep hill to the old part of town, known 
as al-Balad. Between the two lies a vast cement factory, Jordan's biggest and 
Fuheis's main claim to fame: over seventy percent of the town is employed at 
the plant, but local people have suffered for years from clouds of cement dust 
and soaring rates of asthma. There have long been calls to raise standards or 
relocate the fifty-year-old plant away from populated areas: it remains both a 
blessing for the town, and a curse.
Al-Balad comprises a district of quiet lanes and hundred-year-old stone 
cottages alongside the deep Wadi Rahwa. It had been slated for demolition 
when, in 1992, a local character opened an art gallery here; he then bought up 
the cottages one by one and converted them into a self-contained arts and crafts 
neighbourhood, known as Rowaq al-Balqa (shops open daily except Tues 
4-10pm; Wwww.rowaq.net). This quarter makes for an interesting short wander, 
and the tiny rural lanes come into their own in the golden light of late 
afternoon. During August, Fuheis hosts a small-town carnival of music and 
dance, while a recent innovation is the Fuheis Festival (Wwww.fuheisfestival

Practicalities
On the road north from Amman past Jordan University, just beyond the centre 
of Sweileh, a crossroads town on the northwestern fringes of Amman, take the 
clearly marked turn-off towards Salt. This minor road winds through pine forest, 
passing the Royal Stables at Hummar before entering Fuheis. The town is 
served by buses from Amman's Tabarbour station. If you're coming from Wadi 
Seer, Salt or Jerash, aim for Sweileh; dozens of buses stop at or near the large 
roundabout beneath Sweileh's trademark flyover, from where you can pick up 
the Amman-Fuheis buses (ask the locals where to stand). All Fuheis buses run 
through al-Allali down to their terminus beside a grandiose equestrian statue 
which dominates the tiny al-Balad roundabout. Note that the last bus back to 
Amman leaves at around 9pm in summer, 7pm in winter.
Tucked away in renovated old stone houses in the Rowaq lanes are a couple of 
good Arabic restaurants. Top choice is the excellent and reasonably priced 
A Zuwwadeh (daily 10am-midnight; T06 472 1528, Wwww.zuwwadeh.com), in 
an atmospheric house shaded by a giant eucalyptus tree. This is a favourite informal 
out-of-town dining spot for affluent Ammanis; the fact that Fuheis is Christian 
gives it an allure of decadence for urbanite Muslims seeking to let their hair down 
a little, and on weekend nights in particular the place is crowded with families and 
groups of friends. Zuwwadeh's kebabs and fatteh are superb, but you could choose 
from their inventive list of mezze and dine lavishly for less than JD10. There is live 
music nightly from an accomplished oud player. One speciality of the house, which 
is likely to put an interesting spin on your journey back to Amman, is an alcoholic 
argileh - it looks the same as the ordinary version, but instead of water in the bubble 
chamber the management substitute araq. Book ahead, at weekends especially.

Wadi Seer
Though barely 12km from central Amman, the town of WADI SEER ("Valley 
of Orchards") - small and peaceful, filled with trees and birdsong - has the 
atmosphere of the countryside. Add to the natural beauty a couple of small-scale 
archeological gems and the area merits an exploratory picnic, although, if you 
choose a Friday for your outing, you'll discover that most of Amman has had 
the same idea. Buses from Amman depart from Muhajireen station and drop 
off at Wadi Seer's bus station, perched above a roundabout in the town centre.
Originally settled by Circassian immigrants in the 1880s, Wadi Seer boasts 
many nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Ottoman stone buildings in the 
streets around the centre, including a red-roofed mosque of yellowish limestone 
with one of the most beautifully carved minarets in the country.
Wadi Seer is the staging-post for a journey out to the striking Hellenistic 
palace of Qasr al-Abd, located 10km west alongside the village of Iraq al-
Amir. It's easy to charter a taxi in Wadi Seer to take you to the qasr, wait and 
bring you back (about JD6-8), or to take a bus (see below) to the qasr gates, 
but this is a lovely part of the country in which to dawdle, and the walk along 
the road from Wadi Seer to Iraq al-Amir slopes gently downhill all the way, 
hugging the side of a fertile valley and passing through a series of villages. The 
scenery is soft on the eye, the valley thick with fig, olive, cypress and 
pomegranate trees and watered by a perpetually flowing stream; springtime sees 
a riot of poppies and wild iris. However, banish thoughts of riverside footpaths 
and unspoilt nature: the walk is all on the tarmac road and this is Jordanian 
country life in the raw - litter, half-built houses, curious children and all.
Iraq al-Amir
A road leading from Wadi Seer town-centre roundabout is signed "Iraq 
al-Ameer Street". About 4km out, it reaches the valley floor and passes a 
Roman aqueduct; the spartan al-Yannabeea café (daily 7am-midnight) 
occupies a perfect spot on the grassy bank here - good if you fancy a cold drink, 
though the food isn't up to much. They have usable toilets.
Just before the café, a detour for the energetic leads steeply up to the left; after 
about 500m, a fork to the left gives access to rough paths up the hillside. A short 
scramble will bring you to two eerie caves known as ad-Dayr (meaning "the 
monastery"). They look rather like a medieval pigeon-fanciers' den: the interiors 
are lined with small triangular niches, and stone grilles are still in place over the 
cave windows.
Beyond the café, the road continues straight - apart from one left fork marked 
in English - for another 6km or so to IRAQ AL-AMIR (meaning "Caves of 
the Prince"). Just before you reach the village, you'll spot the smoke-blackened 
caves high up to the right of the road. However there's not much to get excited 
about: most are malodorous, and there's nothing to see but the view across the 
fields and a single ancient Hebrew inscription beside one of the cave entrances, 
referring to the family who built the white palace visible down in the valley. In 
the village itself, in an old stone cottage, is a handicrafts project (Sat-Thurs 
8am-3pm) staffed by local women producing a variety of top-quality items, 
including handmade paper (the only such centre in Jordan), textiles, foods such 
as zaatar and olives, ceramics and more. Everything is on sale here and in craft 
shops around the country.
Qasr al-Abd
After passing through Iraq al-Amir village, the road ends about 1km further on 
at the gates of the Qasr al-Abd, a strikingly beautiful pre-Roman country villa 
THE DEAD SEA AND AROUND | The Balqa hills

150
set on a platform above the fields. The villa was begun in the years around 
200 BC by Hyrcanus, a member of the powerful Tobiad family, as the centre-
piece of a lavish, cultivated estate; its name, meaning "Palace of the Servant", 
derives from a fifth-century BC member of the clan, who is mentioned in the 
Old Testament as being a governor, or "servant", of Ammon. Hyrcanus died in 
175 BC and the palace was never completed; indeed, for some reason the huge 
limestone building blocks - some up to 25 tonnes in weight - were originally 
laid precariously on their half-metre edges, and dutifully collapsed at the first 
earthquake, in 365 AD. Since then, the building has been only sporadically 
occupied, possibly during the Byzantine period by Christian monks. It was only 
in the 1980s that the palace could be partially reconstructed by industrial cranes; 
before then, the fallen masonry was too heavy to be reassembled.
When you arrive, the guardian will probably materialize to unlock the gates. 
Inside, only a few courses of the internal walls still stand, although picture 
windows still ring the building and stairs lead up to a now-collapsed second storey. 
The main attractions, though, are outside. Around the walls are elegant carvings 
of wild animals, appropriate for such a rural setting although it's unlikely such 
beasts roamed the area even in antiquity. At ground level on both sides of the 
building are dolomite leopards doubling as fountains, and around the top of the 
walls are eagles and lions. The best of all, high up on a back corner, is a lioness - 
complete with mane for some reason - suckling her cubs.
Off to one side of the villa is a small modern building housing a museum
(open on request), housing photos of the site and some informative notes, 
including translations of a text by the first-century Roman historian Josephus 
describing the villa and its animal carvings in uncannily accurate detail. If the 
electricity is on, the guardian will play the excellent historical slide-show for 
you; even if it's off, he still deserves a tip (JD2-3).

Jerash and the north
T
he rolling hills of northern Jordan hold some of the loveliest 
countryside in the whole Middle East, acres of olive and fig trees, 
patches of ancient pine forest and fields of wheat, interspersed with 
fertile, cultivated valleys pointing the way west down to the deep 
Jordan Valley. This is the most densely populated part of the country, and every 
hill and wadi has its village. Many of the local people are Jordanian, but plenty 
of towns also have a significant population of Palestinians, who continue to 
farm the East Bank of the Jordan much as they did the West Bank and Galilee 
before having to flee in the wars of 1948 and 1967.
In biblical times, this was the greater part of the area known as the Decapolis
(more information on p.156), and extensive ruins of important Roman cities 
survive, most notably at Jerash, north of Amman, and Umm Qais, in the far 
northwest. West of Jerash, the ruins of an Arab-built Crusader-period castle 
dominate the hills above Ajloun, which is also the location for the lovely 
Ajloun Forest Reserve, set amid isolated forests of evergreen oak. 
To the west is the swelteringly subtropical Jordan Valley, more than 200m 
below sea level, carrying the trickling River Jordan south to the Dead Sea. 
Ongoing excavations here at the Decapolis city of Pella have revealed contin-
uous habitation for at least five thousand years before the Romans arrived.
Buses link all towns and - with less regularity - just about every village. Jerash 
deserves at least half a day, preferably more, and you should clear a night in your 
JERASH AND THE NORTH | 
Ideas for exploring northern Jordan
Most tourists never venture further north than Jerash - such a pity, since this can be 
a rewarding area to visit, very different from the desert. Even if you're relying on public 
transport, it's easy to construct a one-night tour: start with a bus from Amman's 
Tabarbour station to Ajloun (p.167), for a morning exploring the castle, the town and 
the olive groves. Then move on to the Roman ruins at Jerash (p.154) before taking a 
late-afternoon bus to Irbid (p.173). Next day, return direct to Amman or extend the 
trip with a morning at Umm Qais (p.176).
Renting a car (see p.39) gets you easy access to the beautiful Ajloun Forest 
nature reserve (p.170) or rural walks such as the Al-Ayoun Trail (p.169). The tour 
outlined above works ﬁne - best visit Jerash ﬁrst, before Ajloun - or, if you're starting 
from the Dead Sea for instance, you could drive through the Jordan Valley to Pella
(p.182), continue to Umm Qais for lunch, and head via Irbid to Ajloun for dinner and 
overnight in the reserve, with a half-day walk next morning and an easy drive on to 
Salt (p.145), Jerash or Amman.

schedule to stay (and walk) in the wonderful Ajloun Forest Reserve, which is 
hard to reach without a car.
Jerash
One of the best-preserved and most explorable Roman cities in the eastern 
Mediterranean, set in the bowl of a well-watered valley about 50km north of 
Amman, JERASH is the principal focus of a trip into northern Jordan. With 
its monumental and sophisticated public buildings tempered by charmingly 
human touches, the ancient city is likely to inspire even if you are on the jaded 
final leg of a ruin-hopping tour of the region.

JERASH AND THE NORTH | Jerash

155
Jerash is a huge site, and easily merits a full day; if you have only a couple of 
hours, you could rapidly absorb the Oval Plaza - with its temple and theatre 
- the Cardo, the Sacred Way leading up to the Temple of Artemis and the 
North Theatre, but without really doing the place justice. Make sure you 
time your visit to coincide with one of the shows of Roman-style chariot 
racing (see box, p.161) that are staged daily in the hippodrome: they are 
quite a spectacle.
Some history
Set in the fertile hills of Gilead, which is mentioned frequently in the Old 
Testament as being a populated and cultivated region, the Jerash area has 
attracted settlement since prehistory: Paleolithic and Neolithic implements have 
been uncovered nearby, and archeological investigation around the South Gate 
of the city has revealed evidence of settlement going back to the Middle Bronze 
Age (around 1600 BC).
Gerasa (the ancient name for Jerash) was founded around 170 BC, the 
relatively small settlement of that time focused around the Temple of Zeus 
and the low hill opposite. Very little evidence of this Hellenistic period 
survives today. 
It was around this time that the idea of the Decapolis first emerged (see box). 
Gerasa and its Decapolis neighbours were "liberated" by the Romans under 
Pompey in 63 BC and granted autonomy under the higher authority of the 
Province of Syria. The century which followed saw unprecedented growth 
and stability in Gerasa, and it was during the first century AD that the basic 
town plan as it survives today was laid down: a colonnaded north-south axis cut 
by two colonnaded side-streets, along with a temple to Zeus (built over the 
pre-existing temple) fronted by an oval plaza, expansion of the temple to 
Artemis and construction of the South Theatre.
In 106, when Emperor Trajan reorganized Roman authority in the region 
around his new Province of Arabia, Gerasa lost its autonomy and was governed 
from the provincial capital, Bosra. Gerasa gained a link by a branch road to 
Trajan's new highway running between Bosra and the Red Sea, while other 
main roads linked the city with Philadelphia and Pella. Suddenly, Gerasa found 
itself not only close to the provincial capital but also astride the highly lucrative 
trade routes that had been jealously guarded by the Nabateans for so long. In 
129-130, Gerasa briefly became the centre of the Roman Empire, as Trajan's 
successor, Hadrian, wintered in the city; in his honour, the Gerasenes built a 
new monumental arch outside the southern walls, and embarked on major 
expansion works, including widening of the main street and renovation of 
temples and public buildings. Hadrian's visit ushered in a golden age for the city, 
and Gerasa's population may have touched 25,000 during the later second and 
early third centuries.
Civil disorder in Rome in the 190s heralded the end of the boom. Taxation 
increased to help cover greater military expenditure - which fuelled further 
resentment, as well as crippling inflation - and the Persian Sassanians began to 
whittle away at the eastern flanks of the empire. Trade was seriously affected, 
and in Gerasa the lavish programme of public works was cut back.
A sea change took place when, in 324, Christianity became the official 
religion of the eastern empire. Gerasa embraced the new religion shortly after-
wards, and during the fifth and sixth centuries dozens of churches went up, 
though pre-existing buildings were ransacked for stones and columns, giving a 
botched, make-do feel to many of Gerasa's churches. By the late seventh 
century, the city was literally crumbling from shoddy workmanship and lack of 
JERASH AND THE NORTH | Jerash

156
maintenance. Persian forces were able easily to occupy the once-grand 
metropolis for a dozen years or so from 614.
After the Muslim victory over the Byzantines in 636, it was long theorized 
that Gerasa - subsequently arabized to Jerash - had slipped into anonymous 
decline: a small, jerry-built Umayyad mosque and a handful of kilns were the 
only evidence from the Islamic period in the city. However, one of the most 
exciting recent digs has uncovered a large congregational mosque from the 
Umayyad period in the heart of the city centre, with what has been suggested 
is a governor's house attached. Work is ongoing, but it seems Jerash may have 
been stronger and more populous in the early Muslim period than was previ-
ously thought. Nonetheless, the cataclysmic earthquake of 749 seems to have 
brought the city to its knees, and for a thousand years Jerash lay deserted.
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, European explorers - including, 
on a four-hour visit, Burckhardt - were taken around the ruins by local 
The Decapolis
From the time of Alexander the Great, a group of around ten important cities of the 
Middle East began to be associated together. Bastions of urban Greek culture in the 
midst of a Semitic rural population, these cities were founded or re-founded during 
or following Alexander's consolidation of power in the Levant in the late fourth 
century BC. Decapolis means "Ten Cities" in Greek, but classical authors disagreed 
on both the number and identity of the ten: one list, from the ﬁrst century AD, 
comprises, in modern-day Jordan, Philadelphia (Amman), Gadara (Umm Qais), 
Gerasa (Jerash) and Pella; in modern Syria, Damascus, Raphana, Hippos, Dion and 
Canatha; and in Israel, Scythopolis (Bet She'an). Although it's tempting to imagine 
the Decapolis cities working together in a formal league of cooperation, no records 
survive of such a pact, and it seems instead that the term was used simply to refer 
to the geographical area of northern Transjordan and southern Syria: the Gospels of 
Matthew and Mark, for example, mention the Decapolis only as a region. All that can 
be said for sure is that the Decapolis cities shared a common history and culture.
After the Roman armies arrived in 63 BC, the area enjoyed a sizeable degree of 
both afﬂuence and autonomy. The population within the cities - by this stage 
predominantly of Middle Eastern origin - spoke much more Greek than Latin (the 
latter was only used on formal occasions and in ofﬁcial documents), and were almost 
certainly also ﬂuent in Aramaic, the language spoken in the countryside. Even in its 
heyday, Jerash, for instance, remained at core a Semitic society, its ancient local 
traditions overlaid with Greco-Roman ideas.
By the second century, the Decapolis appears to have expanded; a list from this 
period names eighteen cities, including, in Jordan, Abila (Qwaylbeh), Arbela (Irbid) 
and Capitolias (Bayt Ras, near Irbid). However, historical confusion subsequently 
reigns supreme, with some authors indicating the Decapolis to be a part of Syria, 
others seeming to show that Syria was a part of the Decapolis, and still more 
including cities that seem to have played no part in the common history and culture 
of the original ten. It was Emperor Trajan who effectively broke the cultural bonds in 
the Decapolis and sowed the seeds of this confusion. His Province of Arabia, created 
in 106 AD, included only some of the cities: Pella and Scythopolis, for instance, 
remained within the Province of Syria. Bosra became the new provincial capital, and 
although Decapolis centres such as Gerasa and Philadelphia subsequently experi-
enced a golden age in culture and sophistication, Trajan's reorganization ensured that 
their horizons now encompassed more than merely their own region: they were 
bonded ﬁrmly into the greater Roman order. By the time of the division of empire into 
east and west under Diocletian at the end of the third century, the notion of a special, 
parochial link between the cities of the Decapolis was dead.
JERASH AND THE NORTH | Jerash

157
bedouin, and news of the "discovery" of the ancient city of Gerasa spread 
rapidly. Throughout the nineteenth century, and up until the present day, arche-
ological investigation at Jerash has been continuous and wide-ranging, although 
large areas remain untouched beneath the grass.
In modern times, a new lease of life for the ancient city came from an 
unexpected quarter. In 1879, in the same process of migration and resettlement 
that brought Circassian settlers to the deserted ruins of Amman, the Ottoman 
authorities directed refugee Circassians to settle in the ruins of Jerash. They 
occupied what is believed to have been the Roman residential quarters, on the 
east bank of the river, and the bustling town which has since grown up there, 
now capital of its own governorate, still has Circassians in the majority.
Practicalities
From the big intersection at Sweileh on Amman's northwestern outskirts - 
reachable from Shmeisani on Queen Rania/University Street or from 8th 
Circle on King Abdullah II/Medical City Street - the highway north plunges 
steeply down the slope into beautiful countryside, with hills on the horizon 
sometimes snowcapped as late as April. After passing Baqaa, the biggest of 
Jordan's UN-run Palestinian refugee camps - today a city of 100,000-plus - 
you'll spot a well-signed turning for "South Jerash" just after a bridge over the 
River Zarqa. This road follows the west bank of the Wadi Jerash, lush with 
eucalyptus and olive trees, for 6km into Jerash itself.
At a set of traffic lights overlooked by the giant Hadrian's Arch, a left turn 
leads to Ajloun, but if you go straight ahead for 50m you'll see a side-turning 
to the left just in front of the arch which heads down to a free parking area
and a fake tourist bazaar, within which is the site ticket office (daily 
7.30am-sunset; JD8). Steps lead up to Hadrian's Arch, from where it's a 400m 
walk beside the Hippodrome to reach the Visitors' Centre (daily 8am-7pm; 
winter closes 5pm), which houses an informative exhibition on the history and 
architecture of Jerash. Alongside the Visitors' Centre is the Resthouse restaurant, 
an office co-ordinating local guides and the mighty South Gate, main entrance 
to the ancient city.
Public buses and serveeces from Amman's Tabarbour station, Irbid, Ajloun 
and elsewhere arrive at the bus station, sited on the Ajloun road 800m west 
of Hadrian's Arch (try and persuade the driver to drop you at the arch 
instead, to save doubling back). Local serveeces and minibuses shuttle 
between the bus station and the town centre. Note that public transport out 
of Jerash ends by about 5.30pm; after that time, you'll have to either hitch or 
negotiate a taxi fare.
Hiring a guide to lead you around the ruins can bring a visit to life: these 
fluent professionals are generally very knowledgeable. Their standard rate is 
JD15 for a tour lasting an hour and a quarter.
The Jordan Festival
Jordan's major summer festival of music and the arts was founded in 1980 as the 
Jerash Festival, staged during July and early August amid the Roman ruins. In 2008 
it metamorphosed into the Jordan Festival. Audiences of thousands pack Jerash's 
open-air theatres as well as venues in Amman and at the Dead Sea to see big-name 
Arab performers, as well as star-studded evenings of jazz, pop and opera, running 
alongside landmark exhibitions of contemporary art and photography. Check 
Wwww.visitjordan.com/jordanfestival for more information.

Accommodation and eating
The only hotel in Jerash is the A Hadrian Gate (T077 779 3907; 3), on the 
main road beside Hadrian's Arch. Run by a cheerful Yemeni, it comprises five 
immaculate doubles and triples, most en suite: go for the private en-suite room 
105 on the roof, with a panoramic terrace. It's slightly overpriced but pleasant - 
and in a great location.
Nicer still is the Olive Branch (T02 634 0555, Wwww.olivebranch.com.jo; 5), in 
the hills 8km northwest of Jerash. Buses to Suf town (not Suf refugee camp) can 
drop you close by. If you're driving, follow roadsigns to Suf until, 7.5km from 
Jerash, you'll spot a sign pointing left to Ajloun (this is where you should ask the 
bus to drop you). From the sign, a minor road winds 1.5km through olive groves 
to the hotel, which is set in a lovely, peaceful location offering an enormous 
panorama out over the hills. (Another route to the hotel comes off the Jerash-
Ajloun road: take an Ajloun minibus, ask to be dropped at the hotel's sign, and walk 
2km along the turn-off road.) A taxi fare from Jerash is about JD5. The hotel's airy 
rooms are all en suite, comfortable and clean; some have a balcony and a few boast 
two-person bathtubs in the room. You can camp in their grounds - which include 
a shaded swimming pool - for JD12 (less if you bring your own tent).
For eating, few visitors bother to explore beyond the JD10 lunchtime buffet 
at Jerash's Resthouse (T02 635 1437) beside the Visitors' Centre, priced high for 
the location (and the a/c) rather than its distinctly average cuisine. An adjacent 
café section sells cold bottled beer. After years of mediocrity, the Lebanese House
(T02 635 1301, Wwww.lebanese-house.com), set amid fields off a country lane 
750m south of Hadrian's Arch (signposted from the Ajloun road), is once again 
a fine choice for all kinds of mezze and grills; gastronomes are arguing about 
whether it has regained its status as the best restaurant in the area. Considerably 
down the scale, the al-Khayyam, virtually opposite the Visitors' Centre, has a 
standard range of kebabs and mezze, while at the Irbid junction in the northern 
part of town are a few more Arabic garden restaurants.
Hadrian's Arch and the Hippodrome
The first monument you see as you approach Jerash from Amman is the huge 
Hadrian's Arch, poised over a traffic junction. The eleven-metre-high triple-
arched gateway, which originally stood to almost 22m and which has been 
restored and partially reconstructed, was built to honour the visit of the Roman 
Emperor Hadrian to Jerash in 129-130 AD. The huge arches, which probably 
had wooden doors, are flanked by engaged columns unusually decorated with 
capitals at the bottom rather than the top. Over 400m from the city walls, the 
positioning and structure of the arch point to a grandiose scheme for southward 
expansion of Gerasa. The municipal authorities seem to have been envisioning 
the arch as an enormous city gate, since its side walls were left untrimmed to 
enable tight bonding with new perimeter walls. The plan remained unrealized, 
however, and when it became clear, maybe a century or so later, that the city 
wasn't going to expand, two small side-pavilions, with niches mirroring the 
arch's side entrances, were added.
On the west side of Hadrian's Arch, an array of small arches belongs to the 
reconstructed south wall of the Hippodrome, which has undergone 
extensive renovation work. This was the scene of ancient Gerasa's sporting 
festivals and chariot races; 1500 years on, it is again (see box, p.161). At 244m 
long, and seating up to 15,000 spectators, it is impressively large for Jerash, but 
is nonetheless the smallest hippodrome so far discovered in the Roman 
Empire: by contrast, the Circus Maximus in Rome could accommodate over 
157,000 people. Jerash's arena has garnered international attention, though,

for the preservation of remnants of its original starting-gates as well as some 
areas of original seating.
Walking north towards the Visitors' Centre takes you past a series of shops 
built into the Hippodrome on the left, and the small, ruinous Byzantine 
Church of Bishop Marianos on the right, erected in 570 among Roman and 
Byzantine tombs on what was then the main Gerasa-Philadelphia road.
The southern part of the ancient city
Beyond the Visitors' Centre stands the reconstructed South Gate, the principal 
entry point into the ancient city. It seems from the wheel ruts on the thresholds 
that the west door was reserved for wheeled traffic, and that the central and east 
doors were used principally by pedestrians. Near the gate is a section of the 
three-metre-thick wall which originally ran for over 3.5km around the city, a 
fourth-century strengthening of the original, thinner first-century wall.

Beyond the gate, the split-level South Street runs between what is believed 
to be a Hellenistic settlement on the right, and the restored vaults supporting 
the lower terrace of the Temple of Zeus complex to the left. It gives onto 
what is one of the most impressive pieces of Roman urban design in the world, 
the Oval Plaza. The plaza comprises a large central paved area enclosed by two 
curving colonnades, both irregular bent ellipses and of different lengths, 
forming an elegant, smooth entry into the city proper while deftly linking the 
east-west axis of the Temple of Zeus with the north-south axis of the main 
street, the Cardo. Approaching from the south, the shorter western arm of the 
colonnade draws your eye (and your feet) towards the opening of the Cardo, 
which may originally have been marked by a prominent triple arch. Beautiful 
stone paving swirls around the plaza following the curve of the Ionic colon-
nades. Two slightly wider intercolumnar spaces on the west show where small 
side-streets led in from residential districts. The podium in the centre of the 
plaza may have supported a statue; in the seventh century, a water tank was built 
around it, and pipes are still visible set into the paving.
The South Theatre
From the plaza a track climbs west up to the South Theatre, the most magnifi-
cent of all Jerash's monuments and the largest of the city's three theatres. Now 
extensively restored, it was built in the 90s AD to seat over three thousand, the 
cost of construction partly offset by contributions from wealthy Gerasenes. 
Chariot racing
Jerash is the backdrop for a revival of the Roman sport of chariot racing, with 
choreographed contests and displays of Roman military prowess staged in the 
restored Hippodrome (see Wwww.jerashchariots.com). The company RACE 
("Roman Army and Chariots Experience") organizes the reconstructions, which have 
been based on extensive research by academics and enthusiasts - including such 
luminaries as the technical adviser for the Oscar-winning movie Gladiator and an 
Italian actor who drove chariots in the 1950s epic Ben Hur. After surveying Roman 
hippodromes around the world, experts settled on Jerash as being the most suitable, 
for its modest size, good state of preservation and well-visited setting.
From the earliest days of Classical Greece, around 650 BC, right through to the fall 
of Constantinople in 1453, chariot races followed a broadly similar format - four 
chariots competing around seven anticlockwise laps of the arena. The Jerash re-
enactments follow the same guidelines. Ben Hur summons up images of gleaming, 
armour-plated war-chariots racing improbably quickly behind four horses, but in 
reality the Romans (unlike the Britons and the Celts) used chariots only for racing, not 
in battle, so they built less visually impressive, but much faster, ﬁfty-kilogram wicker-
work chariots, drawn by two horses. The new Jerash chariots fall somewhere 
between Hollywood romanticism and the ﬂimsy, but historically accurate, truth.
The shows - with music, live English commentary and historical scene-setting 
- are impressive, featuring trumpeters, legionaries in authentic Roman battledress, 
gladiators armed with swords and tridents and, of course, charioteers, everything 
meticulously choreographed. All the costumes and equipment have been 
manufactured in Jordan, and everyone involved in the show is from Jerash - most 
are ex-army or police. RACE keeps around seventy locals in salaried employment 
as actors, technical crew and stable-hands: for this reason, if no other, the project 
deserves your support.
There are shows all year round (Sat-Thurs 11am & 2pm, Fri 11am; JD12), except 
in bad weather. In winter the Friday show is moved to 10am, and during Ramadan 
there are no shows on Tuesdays. Buy tickets on the spot.

Inscriptions record such generosity, and lower seats on the shadier western side 
of the auditorium are numbered (notable citizens could presumably reserve 
these prime spots). You enter the theatre into the orchestra, and there are plenty 
of acoustic games to play: talking while standing at the midpoint of the 
orchestra gives an effect as good as a PA system, and if two people at opposite 
ends stick their heads into the round indentations below the seats they can hear 
each other's mutterings quite clearly. The stage has been restored in stone - it 
was probably wood originally - and the scaenae frons, or backdrop, would have 
had another storey on top of the beautifully carved detail that exists today.
The Temple of Zeus
Adjacent to the theatre on the same hill, the Temple of Zeus in its heyday 
must have towered over the city, and, like its sister temple of Artemis in the city 
centre, was intended to be visible from all parts of Jerash. Originally surrounded 
by gigantic Corinthian columns 15m high (the three that are standing now 
were re-erected in 1982 in the wrong place), the temple was built in 162-163 
AD on the foundations of a first-century predecessor, which itself replaced a 
temple from the second century BC. The inner sanctum is plain and simply 
decorated, and the massive front wall is 4.5m thick to accommodate stairs up to 
the roof. In front of the temple, huge dismembered columns have lain 
untouched since the day of some cataclysmic earthquake in antiquity; the slope 
they lie on, now covered with earth and overgrown, probably conceals a 
monumental staircase. From above, the layout of the temenos, or sacred terrace, 
below the temple is clear, with remains of an altar to the left; the far side of the 
temenos is supported on the restored vaults visible from South Street. What is 
also clear from here is the vast extent of ancient Gerasa: as well as the entire 
sweep of the ancient ruins, much of modern Jerash is visible. Behind a minaret 
in a distant space between buildings in the town, you can spot a surviving 
remnant of the eastern city wall.
The ancient city centre
The colonnaded Cardo, the main boulevard of Jerash, leads north from the 
Oval Plaza into the city centre. Some 800m long, the street was originally laid 
out with Ionic columns, but at some point during the remodelling of the city 
in the second century, it was widened as far as the Temple of Artemis and the 
columns updated to the grander Corinthian order. Along the Cardo the 
columns supported a continuous architrave, and a wide covered pavement on 
both sides gave access to shops behind. Because of the gentle gradient, each 
column stands a few centimetres higher, and is slightly shorter, than the last; 
where the column height would have been too small to maintain strict archi-
tectural proportion, the architrave was halted, bracketed into the side of the next 
column and begun again at a higher level. The diagonal street paving is marked 
by deep grooves worn by centuries of metal-wheeled traffic, while round drain 
covers give access to an underground sewerage system.
The four tallest columns in this section mark the entrance on the left to the
macellum, the ancient food market, an octagonal courtyard built around a 
central fountain and surrounded by small shops. Originally there were massive 
tables in four corners of the courtyard; strikingly carved supports survive in the 
farthest corner. Opposite the macellum, steps lead up to the small site museum
(daily 8.30am-5pm; Nov-March closes 4pm), the garden of which is dotted 
with carved sarcophagi and chunks of statuary. Inside are exhibits tracing the 
settlement of Jerash from Neolithic times, including a good explanation of 
ancient coinage.
JERASH AND THE NORTH | Jerash

The South Tetrapylon
A little way further, the Cardo meets the first of Jerash's two major cross-streets, 
the South Decumanus, at an intersection known as the South Tetrapylon. 
At the centre of this circular plaza are four freestanding podia, each of which 
was decorated with shell niches and held four columns topped by a square 
entablature. A statue probably stood between the four columns of each podium. 
This impressive structure was designed to turn a simple street junction into a 
grand meeting point flanked with shops, while not impeding traffic circulation 
from street to street. To the east, the South Decumanus crossed the river into 
what were probably Gerasa's residential neighbourhoods at the South Bridge. 
The bridge has been restored, but a modern fence bars access.
On the southwest corner of the junction, new excavations have revealed a 
large congregational mosque from the eighth-century Umayyad period, set 
crooked to the street so that its three mihrabs faced south towards Mecca. 
What has been suggested is a governor's house stands alongside to the 
southwest, indicating that this spot may have been the city's nexus of power 
at the time. Investigation is continuing, but this building is already providing 
a fascinating link between the pagan Gerasa of the ancient world and 
modern, Muslim Jerash.
The Nymphaeum
From the South Tetrapylon, the Cardo was expanded to its widest extent, and 
Byzantine raising of the pavement included the addition of small niches down 
at ankle level, either for small statues or, possibly, streetlights. The wheel-ruts 
from chariot traffic are particularly pronounced in this section. Eight tall 
columns on the left mark the entrance to the Cathedral (see p.165), while 
beyond, fronted by four even taller columns, is Gerasa's lavish Nymphaeum. 
Completed in 191 AD, and dedicated to dancing, singing water nymphs, the 
Nymphaeum was nothing more than a grandiose public fountain, but the sight 
and sound of water splashing in abundance from such a finely carved 
monument must have been delightful. Even today, dry, the carving which 
survives on the two-storey semicircular recess is impressive. Originally, the 
lower storey was faced in green marble, while painted plaster covered the 
upper storey; traces of the green and orange design survive in the topmost 
niche on the left. Concealing the holes in the lower niches, statues were 
probably designed to appear to be pouring water into the basin below, from 
which lion's-head fountains spat water into shallow basins at pavement level 
(one of Jerash's most endearing small details is the basin carved as four fish 
kissing, their eyes serving as drainage holes). The huge red granite laver in front 
is a Byzantine embellishment.
Beyond the Nymphaeum, thirteen ordinary-sized columns presage four 
gigantic ones marking the entrance to the Temple of Artemis.
The Temple of Artemis complex
The most important edifice in the ancient city, the Temple of Artemis was 
approached via a long east-west Sacred Way which originated somewhere in 
the residential eastern quarters and cut across the Cardo at the point marked 
by the four huge columns. The best way to discern the route is to pick a path 
to the east through the jumble of rubble opposite the four columns and stand 
on top of the apse of what is called the Propylaeum Church, ingeniously 
created from elements of the Roman street. In the sixth century, when the cult 
of Artemis had passed into historical memory, the Christian inhabitants of 
Gerasa sealed off the old Sacred Way with the apse and used the colonnades of 
JERASH AND THE NORTH | Jerash

164
the street as the divisions within the church between nave and aisles. Between 
here and the Cardo, a plaza - decorated with beautiful spiral-twisted columns 
topped with a delicately carved architrave that now lies in chunks nearby - 
became the atrium of the new church. Behind, down below the Propylaeum 
Church, a Roman bridge carrying the Sacred Way once spanned the river; one 
of the few monuments of Gerasa to survive in modern Jerash is the huge East 
Baths building, which you can see opposite.
Back on the west side of the Cardo, a portico leads you to the Propylaeum
itself, a massive, ornately decorated gateway dedicated in 150 AD, which gives 
onto a monumental staircase of seven flights of seven steps. At the top - but still 
well below the temple proper - is a terrace with the foundations of a small 
altar; from here, another monumental staircase, originally over 120m wide, 
takes you up to the level of the sacred courtyard, or temenos, with a dramatic 
view of the temple.
The temple
The Temple of Artemis is set far back in a vast courtyard some 161m deep and 
121m wide, which was originally lined on all four sides with a colonnade and is 
now cluttered with the ruins of Byzantine and Umayyad pottery kilns and 
workshops. The temple has clung onto its huge portico, whose clustered 
limestone columns have turned peachy bronze over the centuries. Inserting a 
long stick or a key between the drums of any of them (the fourth on the left is 
a favourite) demonstrates how these mammoth pillars were designed to sway 
gently, in order to absorb the effects of earth tremors and high winds - and have 
been doing so for almost two millennia without toppling.
The cella, or inner sanctum, is today exposed, but would originally have been 
surrounded by a peristyle of six columns across each short side, eleven on each 
longer side; the capitals of those that stand are still in place, but some elements 
of the entablature have never been found, pointing to the possibility that the 
temple was never completed. The inner walls of the cella would have been richly 
decorated with slabs of marble supported on hooks fitting into the holes all 
round the walls, which were pilfered during the Byzantine period to adorn 
churches. At the back is the single focus of all this wealth of extraordinary 
architecture along the Sacred Way: the niche which once housed the image of 
Artemis, daughter of Zeus and goddess of the forests, who cared for women and 
brought fertility to all creatures.
The northern part of the ancient city
From the Temple of Artemis courtyard, a track leads north to the back of the 
restored North Theatre. Much smaller than its southern twin, this was origi-
nally constructed in the 160s AD to be a small performance space or council 
chamber; many of the seats in the lower rows are marked with Greek names, 
referring to tribes which voted in the city council. On the two ends of the 
semicircular orchestra wall, lovely little stone reliefs show women and boys 
dancing and playing different musical instruments. Upper rows of seats were 
constructed early in the third century to give a total capacity of around 1600, 
but by the fifth century the building seems to have gone out of use as a theatre. 
Much reconstruction and renovation work has been done here, not least in the 
orchestra, with its beautiful marble flooring. The restored theatre saw its first 
public performance in more than 1500 years when, in 1997, the Palestinian poet 
Mahmoud Darwish gave a reading to a packed house.
In front of the theatre is a reconstructed plaza, with huge Corinthian 
columns on one side of the street faced by an equally huge colonnade on the 
JERASH AND THE NORTH | Jerash

165
other that is flanked by unusual double columns ingeniously knitted into the 
walls of the theatre itself. To the right of the plaza, the North Decumanus
meets the main Cardo at a rebuilt junction-point known as the North 
Tetrapylon. Simpler than the South Tetrapylon, this dates from the late second-
century remodelling of Gerasa and comprises arches on all four sides leading 
into a small, domed central space.
On the eastern side of the Cardo rise the huge arches of the West Baths, 
which includes a room fronted by two columns which has somehow clung 
onto its elegantly constructed domed brick roof. A fraction south, an area of 
ruins close to the Cardo is a small Umayyad mosque, with a reused Roman 
shell niche serving as a makeshift mihrab.
Beyond the tetrapylon, the northernmost section of the Cardo is the quietest 
part of the city. Ignored during the city's second-century facelift, this part of the 
street retains its original, plain Ionic colonnade, and is the same width as when 
initially laid out in the first century AD. The peaceful walk ends after some 
200m at the North Gate, dating from 115 AD, from which a road led on to 
Pella. The gate is a cleverly designed wedge shape, in order to present a square 
facade both to the Cardo and to the Pella road. From here, you can either 
continue your northerly progress for 1.5km to visit Birketayn (see below), or 
retrace your steps partway down the Cardo to explore the Cathedral and 
surrounding ruined churches.
The Cathedral and the western churches
Fifteen Byzantine churches have so far been uncovered in Jerash, and wending 
a path through the largely unexcavated southwestern quarter of the ruins to 
visit nine of them, starting with the Cathedral and ending up near the South 
Theatre, brings you out of the main crush of the central sights.
The Cathedral Gateway, marked by eight large columns on the Cardo just 
south of the Nymphaeum, is a large, elaborate construction which originally 
presaged a now-vanished second-century temple, thought to have been 
dedicated to Dionysius. During the fourth century, the old temple was converted 
by the Christian Gerasenes into the large church which survives today, at the 
head of a monumental staircase. The walls flanking the stairs originally 
supported high enclosed and roofed colonnades on both sides, but earthquakes 
toppled the lot. The old pagan temple probably faced west - as does the Temple 
of Artemis - but the new church had to face east: the Byzantine architects seem 
to have been less concerned about aesthetic harmony than their Roman prede-
cessors, and calmly plonked the apse of the new church plum across the head of 
the staircase. To provide some focus for the ascent, a small shell niche Shrine to 
Mary was placed on the blank exterior wall of the apse. Originally dedicated to 
"Michael, Holy Mary and Gabriel", it's still possible to read the Greek for 
Gabriel in red paint on the right of the band beneath the shell.
Left or right from the shrine, the narthex brings you round into the 
Cathedral itself, a shadow of its former self. Little is known about this building, 
and its dedication or even the supposition that it was Gerasa's cathedral remain 
unconfirmed. Colonnades, of which only bits and pieces remain scattered 
about, divided the nave and the aisles, and the high side walls were decorated 
with elaborate glass mosaics. Pale pink limestone flagstones survive in the aisles. 
To the south of the cathedral is a small chapel.
Immediately west of the cathedral, a portico beautifully paved in red and 
white octagons and diamonds leads into the atrium, known as the Fountain 
Court after the square fountain in its centre fed by water brought from the 
great reservoir at Birketayn (see below). Roman historians, including Pliny, 
JERASH AND THE NORTH | Jerash

166
hinted that Gerasa held festivals to Dionysius (the god of wine) at which water 
miraculously turned into wine, and the idea must have been a tenacious one: 
after the Dionysian temple here had been converted into a church, it duly 
became the venue for festivals celebrating Jesus' performance of the same feat 
at Cana. During these festivals, so the historian Epiphanius records, the square 
fountain in this court miraculously began to flow with wine.
To the side of the paved portico is a small room known as the Glass Court, 
named for the enormous quantity of glass fragments discovered there. The 
weeds and rubble carpeting its floor conceal beautiful mosaics, reburied 
for protection.
Left (west) of the Glass Court, a staircase leads up to the tiny Sarapion 
Passage, its octagonal flags running beneath precarious lintels out to the 
Stepped Street. Turning left up the street brings you past the maze of tiny 
rooms forming the Byzantine Baths of Placcus, which date from an 
unusually late 455 AD, evidence that luxurious Roman bathing habits died 
hard. Dominating the baths to the left are twin colonnades of the Church of 
St Theodore, dating from 496. Nothing remains of the main superstructure 
of the building, the marble paving of the nave and aisles or the glass mosaics 
which covered both the interior walls and the semi-dome over the apse; all that 
does remain is the huge apse itself, nosing out dramatically above the Fountain 
Court below.
The western churches
A path from St Theodore's leads west over scrubby hillocks, reaching after 
150m a group of three interconnected churches built between 529 and 533. 
On the right, the Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian houses the best 
of Jerash's viewable mosaics, although the only way to see them is to lean 
over the high wall around the church; the church doors are locked. Cosmas 
and Damian were twin brothers born in Arabia in the late third century, who 
studied in Syria and became famous for always providing medical services for 
free. Their church is floored with a large mosaic open to the elements, which 
shows birds and animals in a geometric grid of diamonds and squares. Just 
below the chancel screen, the dedicatory inscription is flanked by portraits 
of the donors of the church; to the left is Theodore swinging a censer in his 
official robes as a kind of church trustee, and to the right his wife Georgia, 
her hands upraised.
From here, it's possible to work your way back easily to the Resthouse through 
the adjacent circular Church of John the Baptist and Church of 
St George, both with fragments of floor mosaics surviving. Alternatively, you 
could make your way up to the high ground north of Cosmas and Damian, 
where stands the ruined Synagogue Church, invisible from below. A Jewish 
synagogue originally stood here, oriented westwards towards Jerusalem, with a 
floor mosaic depicting the Flood and various Jewish ritual objects. On its 
conversion into a church in 530 or 531, during a period of Jewish persecution 
under Emperor Justinian, a new geometric mosaic was laid over the original, 
and the orientation of the building reversed, with an apse laid in what was 
formerly the synagogue's vestibule.
South of here lie the ruins of the Church of Bishop Genesius, built in 
611 just three years before the Persian invasion and featuring a prominent 
benched apse. On a hill 300m south, tucked inside the southwestern city 
walls not too far from the South Theatre, the Church of Saints Peter and 
Paul and, close by, the Mortuary Church are slowly being reclaimed by 
Mother Nature.
JERASH AND THE NORTH | Jerash

167
Birketayn
Branching off the main route north to Irbid, two smaller roads pass in front of 
Gerasa's North Gate. The road on the left climbs towards Suf, but an easy walk 
along the other, leading directly away from the gate, brings you after 2km to 
Birketayn (Arabic for "two pools"). Set in a shaded valley in a crook of the road, 
this is a Roman double reservoir - restored in the 1960s - which fed water into 
Gerasa. Birketayn was the venue for the notorious Maiumas festivals, nautical 
celebrations of ancient origin which involved, among other things, the ritual 
submersion of naked women. By the time of Gerasa's heyday, the festivals seem to 
have become thinly veiled excuses for open-air orgies, and were duly banned by 
the city's early Christian rulers. In 396 AD the rule was relaxed, provided that the 
festival followed "chaste customs"; however, the pleasures of the flesh seem to have 
proved irresistible, since three years later the ban was reimposed. Some 130 years 
passed before the festival was again resurrected and incorporated by the Gerasenes 
into their Christian faith as a kind of harvest celebration, purged of eroticism.
Overlooking the reservoir stands the thousand-seat Festival Theatre and, 
beyond, a path leads through the trees to the ruined Tomb of Germanus, 
standing amid sown fields, some columns upright and others - along with the 
empty sarcophagus - entwined in thistles down the slope.
Around Jerash
Jerash is set amid verdant hills cut through by countless lush valleys, and even in 
the height of summer, when the hills are baked brown and dry, you'd miss a 
good deal of the beauty of Jordan if you neglected the chance for a trip into 
the countryside. Thick forests of pine, oak and pistachio covered these slopes 
until the early 1900s, when large areas were cleared to provide timber for the 
Hejaz Railway, both for track-building and for fuel. Enough forest has survived, 
though, around Ajloun and Dibbeen - both within half an hour's drive of 
Jerash - to give plenty of walking and picnicking possibilities in what is the 
most southerly area of complete pine forest in the world. Ajloun also has a 
magnificent Crusader-period castle perched among olive groves on a hilltop 
just outside the town.
Ajloun
A thriving market town, AJLOUN (pronounced "adge-loon"), 25km west of 
Jerash, has been a centre of population for a thousand years or more. Marking the 
centre of the town, 150m along the market street from the bus station, is a 
mosque that dates from probably the early fourteenth century. The square base 
of its minaret, as well as the simple prayer hall and carved Quranic inscriptions set 
into the walls, are original; ask the guardian if he will show you around inside.
Ajloun castle (Qal'at ar-Rabadh)
The history of Ajloun is bound up in the story of the castle - in Arabic, the 
Qal'at ar-Rabadh - which towers over it from the west. A perfect location, 
with bird's-eye views over the surrounding countryside and over three major 
wadis leading to the Jordan Valley, the hill on which the castle sits, Jebel Auf, is 
said to have formerly been the site of an isolated Christian monastery, home to 
a monk named Ajloun. By 1184, in the midst of the Crusades, the monastery 
had fallen into ruin, and an Arab general and close relative of Salah ad-Din, Azz
ad-Din Usama, took the opportunity to build a fortress on the ruins, partly to 
JERASH AND THE NORTH | Around Jerash

limit expansion of the Crusader kingdoms (Belvoir castle stands just across the 
River Jordan to the west and the Frankish stronghold of Karak is ominously 
close), partly to protect the iron mines of the nearby hills and partly to show a 
strong hand to the squabbling clans of the local Bani Auf tribe. Legend has it 
that, to demonstrate his authority, Usama invited the sheikhs of the Bani Auf to 
a banquet in the newly completed castle, entertained and fed them, then threw 
them all into the dungeons. The new castle also took its place in the chain of 
beacons which could transmit news by pigeon post from the Euphrates frontier 
to Cairo headquarters in twelve hours. From surviving records, it seems that 
Ajloun held out successfully against the Franks.
Expanded in 1214-15 by Azz ad-Din Aybak (who also worked on Qasr 
Azraq), Ajloun's castle was rebuilt by Baybars after being ransacked by invading 
Mongols in 1260. Ottoman troops were garrisoned here during the seven-
teenth and eighteenth centuries, but when the explorer Burckhardt came 
through in 1812, he found the castle occupied only by forty members of a 
single family. Earthquakes in 1837 and 1927 caused a great deal of damage, and 
consolidation work on the surviving structures is ongoing.
These days, the castle (daily 8am-6pm; Nov-March closes 4pm; JD1) is entered 
from a modern parking area below the walls. A moat bridge cuts through the 
east wall. A long, sloping passage leads up to an older, arched entrance, decorated 
with carvings of birds, and just ahead stands the original entrance to Usama's 
fortress. Although the warren of chambers and galleries beyond is perfect for 
scrambled exploration, with all the rebuilding over the centuries it's very difficult 
to form a coherent picture of the castle's architectural development; there's even 
- in this Muslim-built, wholly Muslim-occupied castle - one block carved with 
a cross, presumably part of the monk Ajloun's monastery. However, a climb to 
the top of any of the towers gives breathtaking views over the rolling landscape, 
and these more than make up for any historical confusion.
Off to the side of the castle road are acres of olive groves, carpeted in spring 
with wildflowers and perfect walking territory.

Walking in northern Jordan
Outside the rainy (and occasionally snowy) winter months, the gentle terrain of north 
Jordan allows walkers to make their own explorations - preferably in the springtime, 
when the ﬂowers are at their best. There are no marked trails, so you're free to 
wander at will over the verdant hills.
A ﬁne two-day trek leads 36km from the fortress of Ajloun down to the ruins of 
Pella. Bring water, since places to replenish supplies are widely spaced. From the 
castle walls at Ajloun you can see the line of the route: west along the ridge, then 
down right into the thickly forested valley and up west to a saddle between 
rounded hills, on the far side of which is concealed the Wadi al-Yabis (also known 
as Wadi Rayyan). The walk down this long and varied valley is particularly 
beautiful, ﬁrst passing through natural forests to reach a knoll on its right side, with 
Ottoman ruins; this makes for an idyllic campsite, with a view to the setting sun 
behind the Palestinian hills. The second day covers about 20km, with a pleasant 
morning walk down through olive groves. The path crosses and re-crosses the 
stream, until a larger stream enters from the right after a couple of hours. Cross 
the conﬂuence and take a track north through well-tended orchards where birds 
dart between pomegranate blossoms in spring. The trail rises steeply to the hilltop 
village of Kufr Abil, from where various options down 6km of country lanes take 
you almost to the Jordan Valley, emerging above the village of Tabqat Fahl at the 
ruins of Pella (see p.182).
This and others walks in the area are described in detail in Jordan: Walks, Treks, 
Caves, Climbs, Canyons by Tony Howard (see p.404).
The Al-Ayoun Trail
In the ﬁrst such cooperative tourism venture in Jordan, three villages north of 
Ajloun, on the edge of the RSCN reserve (see p.170), have clubbed together to 
develop a new walking path. This Al-Ayoun Trail (ayoun means springs) runs for 
12km through some beautiful - and otherwise completely unvisited - countryside. 
It was opening to walkers as this book went to press in 2009: in years to come, 
expect innovations such as trail support, waymarking and a locally run guesthouse 
to open. Until then, it's perfectly possible to walk the route anyway; allow a full day 
and carry plenty of water. The trail begins in Rasun village, a short drive from the 
RSCN headquarters. Past Rasun, at the RSCN's Soap House, the trail forks right 
down into the Wadi Orjan, lush with ﬁgs, pomegranates, carob and cherries, 
before proceeding into Orjan village. The path climbs, offering views into Wadi al-
Yabis/Wadi Rayyan, before dropping into Wadi Abu Kharoub, lined with carob 
trees, and up again past olive groves and a cemetery into Baoun village. After 
zigzagging through the village and beyond, the trail picks up a shepherd track 
which crosses the hills and climbs to a mosque at Listib, ending at the hilltop site 
of Tell Mar Elyas (see p.172).
An excellent full-colour brochure (with map) gives information on nearby sites such 
as Bronze Age dolmen ﬁelds and Byzantine hermitages, as well as the Aisha al-
Baouniya Cultural Forum, established in Baoun to honour the sixteenth-century 
mystic and poet Aisha al-Baouniya, one of Islam's most renowned female Suﬁ 
theologians. The brochure is available locally, or is downloadable at Wwww
.abrahampath.org (the Al-Ayoun Trail has been supported by the Abraham Path Initia-
tive, an international project fostering the development of a long-distance walking 
route from Sanliurfa in Turkey to the Palestinian city of Hebron). Before you set out, 
contact Mahmoud Hawawreh, the English-speaking director of the Cultural Forum 
(T077 707 2212) - or the Orjan municipality (T02 647 5766) - for information, 
guidance and access to local hospitality. They can also give advice about arranging 
transport at either end of the route.

Practicalities
Buses run to Ajloun from Amman, Irbid, Jerash and Kraymeh (in the Jordan 
Valley), but the road from Jerash (23km) is the most beautiful way to approach, 
loping over the hills among stands of pine and olive trees, with the castle silhou-
etted on the horizon for half the way. If you're driving from Jerash, don't miss 
(after 18.5km) the turning right (north) to Ajloun in the town of Anjara. To 
reach the castle, a bus shuttles from Ajloun bus station, infrequently during the 
week but more often on Fridays and Saturdays; reckon on JD6 or so for a taxi
to take you up, wait and bring you down again. If you fancy the stiff walk up 
(3km), start from the town-centre roundabout (topped with a kitsch model of 
the castle) and head up the road with the minaret on your left.
There are two hotels on this quiet castle road, both long past their best: 
service and facilities are very tired. The first is the Qal'at al-Jabal or Jabal Castle
(T02 642 0202; 3), with a nice garden in front; all rooms are en suite and with 
balconies, and some have great castle views. A few hundred metres further up is 
the smaller Ajloun Hotel (T02 642 0524; 3), much the same. Despite their 
drabness, these are both popular with Jordanians for weekend getaways and may 
be full in July and August. Eating options are limited to simple restaurants in 
the town centre: picnicking on the castle slopes is a good alternative.
Around Ajloun
For drivers, the major route down to the Jordan Valley from Ajloun is via 
Anjara and Kufranjeh, but there is a more beautiful back way down between 
the hills. Turn off the castle road at the Jabal Castle Hotel, fork left after 4km and 
right 4km further. The rustic village of Halawa appears after another 7km, in 
the middle of which there's a steeply sloping fork; the road to the left (which 
runs past the post office) will eventually deliver you after 10km of lovely 
countryside around Wadi al-Yabis (also known as Wadi Rayyan) to the Jordan 
Valley highway, or you could follow signs direct to Pella (see p.182).
Ajloun Forest Reserve
One of Jordan's most beautiful hideaways is the Royal Society for the Conser-
vation of Nature's AJLOUN FOREST RESERVE (Wwww.rscn.org.jo), 
spread over remote hillsides about 9km north of Ajloun. This is lovely country-
side, situated around 1200m above sea level - the coolness compared to Jerash 
is noticeable, and when it's sweltering a short drive away in the Jordan Valley it 
can be balmy and fresh up here.
The reserve comprises thirteen square kilometres of rolling Mediterranean 
woodland - mainly evergreen oak, with some pistachio, carob and wild straw-
berry trees along with olive groves. The fauna covers some very European 
names: wild boar, foxes and badgers are all common (alongside striped hyena, 
Asiatic jackals and wildcats), as are birds such as tits, finches and jays. Roe deer
- previously extinct in the wild - have been successfully reintroduced to the 
reserve by the RSCN. Staying a night or two, or just dropping in for a meal and 
a walk, is strongly recommended.
Several walking trails head out from the reserve centre. Of the self-guided 
trails, the Scenic Viewpoint Trail (2km; 1hr) is a short circuit heading up 
through the forest to a nearby hilltop - especially beautiful in springtime when 
wildflowers carpet the ground. More rewarding is the Soap Makers' Trail
(7km; 3-4hr; JD3pp), which leads through the woods and up to the stunning 
Eagle Viewpoint before continuing down into Rasun village to end at the Soap 
House, an RSCN-run community project that employs local women manufac-
turing speciality soaps by hand from olive oil and floral essences. (You can buy 
JERASH AND THE NORTH | Around Jerash

171
the soap, branded as Orjan, here and at every RSCN centre around Jordan.) A 
minibus will run you back to the centre.
Longer trails (all April-Oct only) must be done with an RSCN guide: a group 
of up to five people pays around JD150 for a day's guiding, which also includes 
a locally prepared lunch out in the countryside, often donkeys on hand to take 
some of the strain, and return transport by minibus. The Village Orchards 
Tour (12km; 6hr) extends the Soap Makers' Trail beyond Rasun to pass springs, 
copses and olive groves around Orjan village. The Prophet's Trail (8.5km; 4hr) 
heads off in the other direction, south past caves and across hillside meadows 
before climbing to Tell Mar Elyas (see below); an optional extension, graded as 
"difficult", continues for another 10km (5-6hr) to Ajloun Castle. Another route 
is the Rockrose Trail (8km; 3-4hr), a scenic countryside walk of moderate 
difficulty, crossing wooded valleys and ridges on a beautiful looping path.
Practicalities
There's no public transport anywhere near the reserve: you'll have to either 
drive yourself or go by taxi (JD6-8 from Ajloun). From Ajloun town centre, 
with the castle road to your left, head straight on (north) up the hill on the road 
towards Irbid. After 4.7km, turn left towards Ishtafeina (or Eshtafena) village. (If 
you're coming the other way, this junction lies 24.5km south of the Yarmouk 
University campus in Irbid city centre.) The reserve is clearly signposted down 
4km of twisting country lanes.
The reserve is open all year round (admission 5JD), though note that freezing 
temperatures and snow are common in winter. Always book in advance
directly (T02 647 5673) or through the RSCN's "Wild Jordan" centre in 
Amman (see p.51), even if you're only dropping by for a stroll. With 48 hours' 
notice, staff can prepare a hearty meal (JD10) at the rooftop restaurant. 
Panoramic views from here extend to the West Bank and as far as the 
snowcapped Jebel ash-Sheikh peak in southern Lebanon.
Amid olive trees behind the office is the A accommodation (prices include 
breakfast). To one side are attractive, Scandinavian-style cabins (6) with cement 
floors, raised wooden verandas and comfy beds and sofas; they all have en-suite 
bathrooms and heaters. Across the way is a cluster of wooden lodges, dubbed 
tented bungalows (5). They have canvas walls, but are built above ground on 
stilts, with proper floors, and each has four single beds inside; a shower-and-
toilet block is nearby. The silence up here is wonderful.
Anjara
The small market town of ANJARA sits 3km south of Ajloun on the main road 
up from the Jordan Valley towards Jerash. Local legend has it that Jesus, Mary 
and the disciples once stopped overnight at a cave near the town, where Jesus 
gave a sermon. There's nothing in the Bible about this, but it is known that Jesus 
Prices at Jordan's RSCN-run nature reserves are high. The RSCN makes no 
apologies for this: it says that the reason it exists is to protect Jordan's natural 
environment, and that it has built lodges and developed tourism as a tool for 
generating funds to help conservation and support rural communities. You may or 
may not agree with their pricing policy - but this kind of responsible tourism is 
virtually unknown in the Middle East, and the RSCN are pioneers. For now, until 
tourism schemes emerge that are truly community-owned, paying extra to visit the 
RSCN reserves is a good way to ensure that your money goes to beneﬁt rural 
people and habitats.
JERASH AND THE NORTH | Around Jerash

crossed the Jordan many times, and Anjara then (as now) straddled a junction of 
roads. The exact location of the cave being unknown, in the 1920s an Italian 
Catholic priest, Father Foresto, decided a plot of land in the town would have 
to do for a commemorative church, and arranged for a 150-year-old life-size 
wooden statue of the Madonna to be brought over from Italy. The church went 
up in the 1950s, and then in 1971 Father Nimat - who is still the chief cleric 
in Anjara - built a shrine for the statue in the churchyard, known as Sayyidat 
al-Jebel (or Our Lady of the Mountain), and had its walls decorated with 
(rather kitsch) murals. Following the seal of approval from the Vatican that this 
is indeed a sanctified site, Christian pilgrims now flock to Anjara to visit the 
diminutive shrine in its rubbly artificial grotto. From Anjara's central junction, 
the square steeple of the Catholic church, with its distinctive red roof, is clearly 
visible just below the main road; if the gates aren't open, ask around locally, since 
Father Nimat lives nearby, and will be happy to unlock the shrine for you.
Tell Mar Elyas


Another holy site, this time sacred to Muslims as well as Christians, lies tucked 
away in the hills west of Ajloun - hard to reach without your own transport. Tell 
Mar Elyas (or Elias) is generally accepted as the birthplace of the prophet Elijah, 
who is named in 1 Kings as "Elijah the Tishbite" (Tishbe has long been associ-
ated with Listib, a region lying 8km west of Ajloun) and who is also proclaimed 
in the Quran as a "messenger". The visitable archeological remains are of a large 
church on a windswept hilltop; the driving route, along a beautiful, quiet 
country lane clinging to the contours of the forested slopes, is just as memorable. 
From Ajloun centre, head up the hill towards the castle, then turn off at the 
Qal'at al-Jabal hotel. At a crossroads after 1km, go steeply down to the left. After 
4km, a junction is marked with a sign to Mar Elyas (and another to the village 
of Wahadneh, where there's a modern church dedicated to Elijah); head right 
at the sign for just under 2km, go left for 1km, then take an unsigned dirt track 
left uphill for 400m to the parking area at the foot of the tell. You could walk 
here on the half-day Prophet's Trail from the Ajloun nature reserve (see p.171).
The guardian will probably emerge to greet you as you make the short scramble 
up the rough stairs to the hilltop, where you'll find the ruins of a huge, cruciform 
church, roughly 33m by 32m. Only the foundations and a course or two of stones 
are left. One of the exposed floor mosaics, in white letters on a red background, 
has been dated to 622 AD - a time of upheaval in Jordan, with the Byzantine forces 
in full retreat in the face of the Islamic armies sweeping northwards. There has 
been, as yet, no satisfactory reason put forward as to why the authorities were 
building churches amid such political instability. Beside the apse is a sacristy, 
floored with a plain mosaic, and there are some beautiful mosaic designs surviving 
against the north wall, including multicoloured chevrons and an elaborate drinking 
vessel with grapes. At the western end of the church is a section on a slightly lower 
level, possibly a narthex, which incorporates a deep well beside an ancient oak. 
Many of the trees in the area are bedecked with strips of cloth, tied round the 
branches by devout pilgrims - both Christian and Muslim - as a mark of respect 
for the prophet; a good time to visit is on Elijah's commemoration day of July 21, 
when there are special celebrations.
Dibbeen Forest Reserve
A large area of cool, fragrant, pine-forested hillside southwest of Jerash, the 
Dibbeen Forest Reserve (Wwww.rscn.org.jo) - like its neighbour near Ajloun 
- is a beautiful, and remote, getaway. In 2004 the forest (about eight square 
kilometres) was declared a protected area under the RSCN, who have begun a 
JERASH AND THE NORTH | Around Jerash

173
scheme to promote environmental conservation and launch sustainable develop-
ment with local people. International hotel developers have also got their eyes on 
this forest, and legal disputes about where - and how much - building work may 
be done are ongoing. For now you are free to visit for walks or picnics with a view 
amid the stands of Aleppo pine and evergreen oak, but there are no facilities. This 
is a popular spot for family outings: expect Fridays and Saturdays to be busy.
No public transport runs near the reserve. If you're driving, from the traffic 
lights at Hadrian's Arch in Jerash head towards Ajloun, then after 100m turn left 
and follow signs; this road continues through the Ghazza Palestinian refugee 
camp and down into the lush Wadi Haddada past the reforestation projects at 
Jamla. A taxi from Jerash is about JD6.
Irbid
Although IRBID has been inhabited since Chalcolithic times and has also been 
identified as the Decapolis city of Arbela, almost nothing survives from its 
ancient past. This busy, crowded city - around 75km north of Amman - is genial 
enough, with rambling souks filling the downtown alleyways, but there's little 
to merit a diversion. It is most often visited as a staging-post for journeys into 
the far north of Jordan; if time is short, give it a miss.
The City
Rising above the bustle of the downtown markets is Irbid's tell, its steep streets 
now lined with offices. Behind the municipality building, the old Ottoman Dar 
as-Saraya (Governor's House), built in the mid-nineteenth century, has been 
restored to serve as a rather good antiquities museum (Sat-Thurs 8am-4pm, 
Fri 10am-4pm; Wwww.dam.gov.jo). Admission is likely to be around JD2. 
Rooms around the courtyard exhibit fine pottery from Pella and other Jordan 
Valley sites, as well as Greco-Roman statues from Umm Qais and a splendid 
mosaics collection. Staff can provide information about Irbid and the local area, 
and will also direct you down the street to Beit Arar (Sat-Thurs 8am-3pm; free), 
an atmospheric Ottoman courtyard house - once home to the nationalist poet 
Mustafa Wahbi al-Tal (1897-1949), who wrote under the pseudonym "Arar". It's 
a pleasant place to relax and browse through the displays on the poet's life.
South of the city centre is the campus of Jordan's highly regarded Yarmouk 
University, around which has evolved a funky quarter of studenty restaurants, 
music stores and internet cafés centred on Arshaydat Street (known to all as 
University St). Yarmouk's modest Museum of Jordanian Heritage (Sat-Wed 
10am-5pm; free) is worth a visit; from the main gate, continue straight ahead 
until the second roundabout, and the museum is the second building to the 
right, part of the Institute of Archeology and Anthropology. All periods of 
Jordan's history are explained clearly on informative panels, and illustrated with 
interesting artefacts, from 9000-year-old statues to antique farm tools. Upstairs, 
displays focus on traditional crafts. 
Practicalities
Irbid has numerous bus stations, of which three serve destinations other than 
local villages. The New Amman station (mujemma amman al-jdeed), 200m 
or so east of the Sports City stadium, has buses serving Amman's Tabarbour 
station (including a/c Hijazi coaches), Ajloun, Jerash, Mafraq and elsewhere.

The Valleys station (mujemma al-aghwar), located off Palestine Street about 
2km west of downtown, serves destinations including Mshare'a (for Pella) and 
the Sheikh Hussein Bridge. About 1.5km north of downtown on Fadl al-
Dalgamouni Street is the North station (mujemma ash-shomali), for buses to 
Umm Qais. In addition, Trust International Transport runs comfortable, air-
con buses from its office near the Safeway supermarket direct to Aqaba (daily 
8.30am & 4pm; 6hr; JD11.50). Minibuses link all the bus stations (though they

are marked in Arabic only - ask around for help). A taxi fare across the city 
shouldn't come to more than JD1.50.
Irbid's best hotel is the Al-Joude (T02 727 5515; 3), near the Yarmouk 
campus, hidden off University Street at the end of quiet Manama Street. It has 
clean and spacious en-suite rooms, friendly staff and the excellent News Café
downstairs (who provide a room-service menu). The same owners are 
planning a new five-star hotel alongside. Otherwise, the best of an unimpres-
sive bunch of rock-bottom cheap hotels in the market streets downtown is 
the Amin, on Orouba Street (T02 724 2384; 1), with cleanish rooms and 
dorms, plus hot showers.
Restaurants are basic. Downtown, falafel and shawerma stalls tempt, or you 
might try the gloomy al-Saadi restaurant on Baghdad Street for plain Arabic fare. 
The KitKat patisserie, along Baghdad Street, serves delicious kunafeh and other 
sweet treats. Virtually every establishment on University Street is an eating 
house of some kind, though many are pretty ordinary. Western-style fast food 
predominates. The buzzing News Café under the al-Joude hotel has decent pizzas, 
pasta, salads, sandwiches and the like, washed down with good coffee or a cold 
beer. Nearby, the Italian restaurant Cortina D isn't bad, though it's no better than 
Pizza Hut up the road. For picnic ingredients, the large supermarket Safeway 
(daily 24hr) isn't far away.
The far north
The land hard up against the Syrian border in the far north of Jordan is hilly 
farming country, especially beautiful in springtime when a riot of colour covers 
the fields between groves of olives and figs. The ancient trees around the pictur-
esque village of Umm Qais, perched on the very edge of the Transjordanian 
plateau, are famed for producing some of the choicest olives in the region, 
although the village is best known for the atmospheric ruins of Gadara - where 
Jesus performed one of his most famous miracles - and for spectacular views out 
over the Sea of Galilee. Below coils the dramatic gorge of the River Yarmouk, 
which flows west to meet the River Jordan just south of the Sea of Galilee, and 
Moving on to Syria or Israel
From Irbid to Syria, serveeces run day and night from the New Amman station to 
Damascus for about JD9; book at the ofﬁce diagonally opposite the Hijazi ticket 
counter and be prepared to show your passport and Syrian visa. It's also possible to 
take a bus from the same station to Ramtha, on the Syrian border some 20km east 
of Irbid, from where serveeces run across the frontier to Der'a for about JD4 (or you 
could hitchhike). There's a departure tax of JD5.
The easiest way to get from Irbid to Israel is with the buses run by Trust Interna-
tional Transport (T02 725 1878), whose ofﬁce is on the main road near the Safeway 
supermarket. Departures are to Nazareth (daily 10am; JD25) and Tel Aviv (Sun-Fri 
10am; JD35). All buses originate in Amman, so timings are subject to trafﬁc condi-
tions (but you still need to be at the Trust ofﬁce 30min in advance), and all cross via 
the Sheikh Hussein Bridge, where you pay a departure tax of JD5. A more 
laborious method is to take a bus or serveece for about JD4 from Irbid's Valleys 
station to the bridge terminal (a taxi is roughly JD25), from where a shuttle covers 
no-man's-land between the two customs posts. On the other side a taxi to the Israeli 
town of Bet She'an, a few kilometres west, costs about 25 shekels.
JERASH AND THE NORTH | The far north

176
which now marks the border between Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan 
Heights (Jawlan in Arabic). Travel along the gorge is restricted. Nestled among 
palm trees and banana plantations below the heights is Himmeh, graced with a 
laid-back air that belies the Israeli watchtowers within shouting distance. Further 
east, tucked away in the peaceful Wadi Qwaylbeh north of Irbid, lie the part-
excavated ruins of Abila, another of the Decapolis cities, featuring a hillside 
rock-cut cemetery decorated with Byzantine frescoes.
Umm Qais
Off the beaten track 30km northwest of Irbid, tucked into the angle of borders 
formed by Jordan, Israel and the Golan, the windswept village of UMM QAIS
is well worth the effort of a long journey, whether you visit on a day-trip from 
Irbid or stay overnight to relish the still twilight and fresh, chilly morning. The 
main attraction is exploring the remote, widespread ruins of the Decapolis city 
of Gadara, some of which are jumbled together with the striking houses of 
black basalt and white limestone of an abandoned Ottoman village.
Since the foundation of the State of Israel in 1948, Palestinians who were 
expelled from or fled their homes have come here specifically to savour the 
spectacular views over their former homeland - the waterfront city of Tabari-
yyeh (Arabic name for Tiberias), the choppy lake itself, and the villages and lush 
countryside of the Galilee. The tradition is continued today by many Palestinian 
Jordanians, who either refuse to travel into Israel on principle or who have been 
denied entry visas.
Umm Qais is a popular choice for Friday outings, when the parking area can 
be filled with family cars and youth-club buses, and the ruins swamped by 
teenagers more interested in having a raucous good time than absorbing the 
atmosphere. Umm Qais is unmissable, but do pick your moment to visit.
Some history
After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, Gadara was founded by the 
Ptolemies as a frontier station on their border with the Seleucids to the north 
 Umm Qais, with the Golan Heights and Sea of Galilee behind
JERASH AND THE NORTH | The far north

177
(gader is a Semitic word meaning "boundary"). In 218 BC, the Seleucids took 
the city, but came under siege a century later from the Jewish Hasmoneans; 
when the Roman general Pompey imposed order throughout Syria in 63 BC, 
he personally oversaw the rebuilding of Gadara as a favour to one of his 
favourite freedmen, a Gadarene. The city won a degree of autonomy, and 
became a prominent city of the Decapolis (see box, p.156).
Roman rule - particularly following Trajan's annexation of the Nabatean 
kingdom in 106 AD - brought stability and prosperity. As at Jerash, Gadara saw 
large-scale public building works during a second-century golden age, 
including construction of the great baths at Himmeh. Literary sources describe 
Gadara at this time as a city of great cultural vitality, a centre for philosophy, 
poetry and the performing arts, where pleasure-seeking Romans came from all 
over the empire. As early as the third century BC, a native of the city, Menippos
had risen to become renowned in Greece as a Cynic philosopher and satirist. 
By the second century AD, the city's Cynic streak was flourishing in the hands 
of Oenomaos, a nihilist and critic, although perhaps the city's best-known sons 
are Philodemus, a mid-first-century BC Epicurean philosopher, and Meleager, 
a highly regarded love poet. Theodoros of Gadara was a famous rhetorician 
of the first century BC, who taught the Emperor Tiberius. Later, two Gadarenes 
of the third century AD stand out: Apsines taught rhetoric in Athens; and the 
scientist Philo refined Archimedes' calculations of mathematical pi.
By 325 AD Gadara was the seat of a bishopric, but its proximity to the 
decisive battles at Pella and Yarmouk, when Muslim armies defeated the 
Christian Byzantines, led to the establishment of Muslim rule over the city well 
before the foundation of the Umayyad caliphate in Damascus in 661. However, 
a series of earthquakes not long afterwards destroyed much of Gadara's infra-
structure, and the town went into rapid decline. At some point in the Middle 
Ages, its name changed to Umm Qais, possibly derived from the Arabic mkes
(frontier station) or maqass (junction).
In 1806, the German traveller Ulrich Seetzen identified the ruins as those of 
Gadara. During the 1890s, a small village grew up on the Roman ruins, the 
inhabitants reusing the pre-cut stones to build their homes around graceful 
courtyards. A modern village soon developed nearby, but people continued to 
occupy the Ottoman cottages right through until 1986, when the 1500 inhabit-
ants accepted payment from the Ministry of Tourism to leave their homes, in 
order to enable archeologists to clear the site for excavation.
However, since then not a single square of village land has been cleared. In the

Gadara's main claim to fame centres on a story recounted in the New Testament 
about Jesus crossing the Sea of Galilee. The following version is in Matthew 
8:28-32:
And when he came to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two 
demoniacs met him, cominF out of the tomAs, so kerce that no one couKd 
pass that way. They cried out, 'What have you to do with us, O Son of God? 
Have you come here to torment us before the time?' Now a herd of many 
swine was feeding at some distance from them. And the demons begged him, 
'If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.' And he said to them, 
'Go.' So they came out and went into the swine and the whoKe herd rushed 
down the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the waters.

the Ottoman cottages into a tourist village and chalet-style hotel. A handful 
of houses were renovated - among them the buildings now housing the 
Resthouse and the museum - but work then stalled. Other schemes have come 
and gone, but for much of the year the abandoned Ottoman village and its 
once-grand Roman neighbour stand quiet, tour groups sweeping in and out, 
weeds growing higher and dust-devils infiltrating the long narrow streets.
The site
The site (daily 7am-sunset; JD3) occupies a hill on the west side of the modern 
village of Umm Qais, with the ticket office up some steps from the car park 
on the south side of the hill. On the way, in a hollow at the turn-off from the 
modern village, you'll pass two Roman tombs; the basalt doorways are 
beautiful, but, disappointingly, there's nothing to see inside.
Following the street along from the ticket office will bring you into the 
abandoned Ottoman village, where you can wander freely in and out of the 
weed-ridden courtyards and dusty alleys. The street leads to the evocative West 
Theatre. The theatre is built entirely of basalt, and its three thousand spectators 
- including VIPs in freestanding high-backed power chairs - had a fine view 
west over the city (now a grassy hill dotted with olive trees). North of the 
theatre is Gadara's most dramatic space, the Basilica Terrace, cut into the 
bedrock on one side and supported by vaulted shops below on the other. Its 
main feature, closest to the theatre, is a square Byzantine church dating from the 
fifth or sixth century. A small narthex opens into an outer circular passageway, 
still paved with coloured geometric tiles, which encloses a central octagon 
demarcated by basalt columns which probably supported a dome. Within the 
octagon, a small depression and apse housed the altar, behind which stands a 
thin, pink marble column carved with a cross. On the north side of the terrace, 
the white limestone paving and columns of the atrium stand in stark contrast 
to the black columns of the church. The atrium gives onto Gadara's main, paved 
street, the Decumanus Maximus, the clear line of which can be traced east 
and west.

Above the terrace to the east rise the restored arches of the Resthouse, but the 
rest of the city extends for a kilometre westward, largely unexcavated beneath 
the fields. About 100m west of the terrace is a ruined podium monument of 
unknown usage. Opposite stands a ruined baths complex. Some 250m further 
on is a colonnaded section of the street, and away to the left are the remains of 
more baths and a small forum. After another 100m you'll spot a circular 
structure, foundations of the tower of a gate across the street, within which steps 
lead down into a locked underground mausoleum. Gadara's West Gate, with 
an exposed section of basalt street, is 200m further on. Alongside the modern 
tarmac road (which formerly ran to Tiberias) are the remains of a hippodrome, 
culminating, 300m further on, in a partly reconstructed monumental gateway
to the city, designed to impress visitors approaching from the Jordan Valley 
below. Looking back from here gives an idea of the enormous size of Gadara in 
its heyday, and the impossible task of excavating it all.
Back at the Basilica Terrace, following the Decumanus around the edge of the 
hill brings you to the grassy bowl of the North Theatre, its stones plundered 
to build the Ottoman cottages. Above, behind a grand gateway, is the site 
museum (daily 8am-6pm; Nov-March closes 4pm), occupying the former 
residence of the Ottoman governor, an elegant building on two storeys, with a 
portico and a lovely, peaceful internal courtyard. Highlights of the collection 
include a headless marble statue of Tyche found in the West Theatre, mosaics 
from around the city and carved sarcophagi.
Practicalities
Buses to and from Irbid's North station stop on Umm Qais's main street. The 
village's only accommodation is the basic Umm Qais Hotel on the main street 
(T02 750 0080; 1). Standard, shared bathrooms are on the reception floor, 
while more comfortable en-suite rooms are up above.
There are good fuul-and-falafel diners either side of the hotel (the fuul up 
here, prepared with sumac and other spices, makes an interesting change from 
Amman-style). However, you shouldn't leave Umm Qais without sitting awhile 
on the terrace of the A Resthouse (T02 750 0555, Wwww.romero-jordan
.com; daily 10am-sunset), a sensitively renovated Ottoman building in the midst 
of the ruins. This gives the single best view in the country, a breathtaking, wind-
exposed 180-degree sweep taking in the Jordan Valley, the Sea of Galilee (with 
the Israeli city of Tiberias in plain view), the Yarmouk Gorge and, most impres-
sive of all, the Golan Heights, pointing the way north towards snowcapped Jebel 
ash-Sheikh (Mount Hermon) on the Lebanese border. A meal here costs around 
JD10 and, since the place is under the same management as Amman's Romero
restaurant, the food is very good.
Himmeh (Mukhaybeh)
In Roman times, Gadara's lavish baths complex, built around the seven hot 
springs at HIMMEH, was grand enough to bear comparison with the fabulous 
imperial baths at Baiae, near Naples. Modern Himmeh - also known as 
Mukhaybeh - is a shadow of its former self, and has been divided by modern 
boundary-drawing: most Roman remains are now in what the locals call 
"Syrian Himmeh", on the north bank of the Yarmouk in territory currently 
occupied by Israel, and there is little or no historical interest in what is 
signposted as "Jordan Himmeh": from Umm Qais head down the steep hill 
to a crossroads, from where the village is 4km straight on.
Hemmed in by the towering Golan Heights - with its easily visible Israeli jeep 
patrols - and lying some 200m below sea level, the village is crowded with palm

180
trees and banana plants that thrive in the sweltering, subtropical conditions. 
However in 2007, following scandals over pollution and poor maintenance, 
Himmeh's spa complex was shut down and demolished. Related businesses, 
including hotels, have also gone under - and the future remains uncertain.
Mamdouh Bisharat, a leading Jordanian philanthropist and patron of the arts 
(see p.99 for details of his cultural salon in Amman) - widely known as the 
"Duke of Mukhaybeh" after a nickname bestowed on him by King Hussein - 
has a farm here employing many local people, and takes an active interest in the 
village's fortunes. He has very kindly offered Rough Guide readers the chance 
to stay - by prior arrangement only - at his private villa in the village, which has 
its own spring and Roman pool. Call Mr Bisharat for details (T079 616 6000).
The Yarmouk Gorge road
Himmeh is as far east along the Yarmouk as you're allowed to venture, but with 
your own transport you can head west alongside a portion of the deep and 
dramatic Yarmouk Gorge (all buses go back up the hill to Umm Qais). The 
views on this tense frontier road are spectacular - even better looking east than 
they are looking west - gazing down into the Yarmouk, across to the Sea of 
Galilee and up to the Golan Heights. Drive slowly and remember you are under 
constant surveillance here from both the Jordanian army and the Israeli army; 
although you might be able to snatch a photo or two of the beautiful scenery, 
or of the wrecked bridge, bombed in the 1967 war and still hanging over the 
gorge, you may find the soldiers objecting. There are checkpoints every few 
hundred metres, for which you should always stop and show your passport. 
After 6km of this you come to a junction where the only option is to turn left, 
and this road delivers you after another 7.5km to the town of Shuneh ash-
Shamaliyyeh (North Shuneh), at the head of the Jordan Valley, a pleasant 
enough little market town. The village of Tabqat Fahl - alongside the ancient 
site of Pella - is a short drive south (see p.184).
Baqoura
Northwest of Shuneh lies Baqoura. This tiny sliver, less than a kilometre square, 
was occupied by Israel in 1967 and returned to Jordan under the 1994 peace 
treaty. It is a military zone: visiting isn't easy, but it's popular as a local beauty 
spot and retains an intriguing cross-border identity. From the Shuneh junction, 
head north for 3.4km to a checkpoint, where they might let you through to 
drive another 1.2km to the end of the road at an army base, where you must 
park your car. If you explain that you're interested in seeing Baqoura, an officer 
may find some transport and accompany you: they won't let you explore here 
alone. From the base a road heads down for about 1km and crosses the Yarmouk 
on a rickety bridge alongside a half-ruined hydroelectric station - the first in 
the Middle East, built in 1927 by Russian engineer Pinchas Rutenberg and 
damaged by Iraqi shelling in 1948. Up above is a hilltop parking area known as 
the "Island of Peace", with a breathtaking view: from here you can see the 
confluence of the Yarmouk and the Jordan just below, with the cultivated fields 
of the Israeli kibbutz Ashdot Yaakov all around, the route of the old railway line 
from Haifa to Damascus visible and cars passing on the Israeli highway opposite. 
Israeli farmers are permitted to rent land here - in Jordan - until 2019: you may 
pass Israeli pick-ups on these roads. This car park, and the surrounding area, was 
formerly where Israeli and Jordanian day-trippers mixed freely, until 1997 when 
a Jordanian soldier, Ahmed Daqamseh, murdered seven Israeli schoolgirls here. 
He is serving life with hard labour, yet his name remains notorious, a blight on 
this beautiful place.

Abila
Lying virtually unknown in the cradle of the lush Wadi Qwaylbeh, 12km north 
of Irbid, the lonely ruins of the Decapolis city of Abila have only just begun 
to be excavated from the grassy fields. Its Roman-Byzantine cemetery, 
comprising dozens of tombs cut into a neighbouring hillside, makes for some 
remarkable exploration: many are still adorned with their original frescoes. The 
experience of stumbling across portraits of long-dead Abilenes gazing back 
into your torchlight from the rock-cut coffins that once held their bones is one 
to be remembered. Bear in mind that you're on your own here: there's no 
development of the site at all, and no facilities for visitors.
By car, follow signs from Irbid for Umm Qais until you reach a set of traffic 
lights about 7km north of the city, where the main Umm Qais road branches 
off left. Continue straight on here until you reach a quiet fork in the road, 
which divides in front of an isolated domed mosque close to Wadi Qwaylbeh 
(11km north of Irbid). Buses running from Irbid's North station towards 
Hartha bear left at this fork, which is a good place to get out, since the best 
way to approach Abila is to head right at the fork; walk or drive exactly 900m 
along this road, and then walk left straight across the fields. This will bring you 
to a dry-stone wall, teetering over the steep flank of the Wadi Qwaylbeh. 
Prominent against the sky on a hilltop opposite is a columned seventh-century 
church, while the slope below the wall shelters Abila's necropolis. Very near the 
wall are two of the beautifully painted tomb caves, while others are scattered 
across the slope; persistent exploration is required. The caves which hold 
frescoes are gated and locked, but it's likely that the guardian (a local shepherd) 
will arrive to lead you around. Some frescoes are in remarkably good 
condition, delightful portraits of men and women, flowers and fruits, and one a 
spectacular scene of dolphins covering the ceiling.
Working your way north (right) along the cave-dotted slope brings you, after 
about 2km, to a modern building which overlooks the Roman bridge across 
the stream, leading into the ancient city centre past the remains of a large 
Byzantine church. You can make out the bowl of a theatre next to a section of 
basalt-paved Byzantine street. Follow the track curling up to the hilltop 
church, with its alternating basalt and limestone columns. Olive groves conceal 
the Hartha road from the church; once on the road, you could hitch a ride back 
to Irbid, or wait for the (infrequent) buses.
The northern Jordan Valley
The deep cleft of the Jordan Valley carries the River Jordan south from the Sea 
of Galilee (some 200m below sea level) to the Dead Sea (400m below), a distance 
of only 104km as the crow flies, but the meandering river twists and writhes for 
more than three times that length. Set down in a deep gorge flanked by a desolate 
flood plain (the zor), the river is never visible from the main road, which runs 
through the ghor, or cultivable valley floor, well to the east. Flanked by 900-metre-
high mountains on both sides and enjoying a swelteringly subtropical climate of 
low rainfall, high humidity and scorching temperatures, the valley with its fertile 
alluvial soil is perfect for agriculture on a large scale: this vast open-air green-
house can produce crops up to two months ahead of elsewhere in the Middle East 
and can even stretch to three growing seasons annually. As early as five thousand 
years ago, foodstuffs from the valley were being exported to nearby states, and 
irrigation systems and urban development progressed hand-in-hand soon after. 
JERASH AND THE NORTH | The northern Jordan Valley

182
Agriculture has remained at the heart of the valley economy, from the wheat, 
barley, olives, grapes and beans of the Bronze Age to an extensive sugar-cane 
industry under the Mamlukes. Since the late nineteenth century, rapid develop-
ment - and, in particular, the building of the King Abdullah Canal in the 1960s 
to irrigate the eastern ghor - has led to a burgeoning agricultural industry that 
supplies most of Jordan's tomatoes, cucumbers, bananas, melons and citrus fruits, 
as well as producing a surplus for export.
In contrast to the prosaic vistas of concrete piping, plastic greenhouses and 
farm machinery that characterize the area today, well over two hundred arche-
ological sites have been catalogued in the valley, although - with the notable 
exception of the Roman-Byzantine remains at Pella - almost all of them are 
Neolithic or Bronze Age settlements on the summits of tells, with little to see 
other than stone foundations. South of Pella, a few kilometres from the river's 
outflow into the Dead Sea lies the Baptism Site of Jesus, covered on p.137.
Transport in the valley mostly comprises buses shuttling north and south 
along the highway between the main hubs of Shuneh ash-Shamaliyyeh, 
Kraymeh, Dayr Alla and Shuneh al-Janubiyyeh, stopping at all points in 
between. Bearing in mind the excessive heat - summer temperatures regularly 
top 45°C - and the lack of tourist facilities, the best way to see the valley is in 
your own vehicle. By bus, you could devote either a half- or a full-day to the 
trip, starting from Irbid and heading south to end in Amman, or vice versa. The 
only accommodation comprises a few rooms at Pella.
Pella and around
For archeologists, PELLA, comprising a large tell overlooking a well-watered 
valley protected by hills, is quite thrilling, possibly the most significant site in 
all of Jordan; evidence has been found of human activity in the area for 
nearly a million years, with extensive remains from almost all periods from 
the Paleolithic through to the Mamluke. The tell itself has been occupied for 
the last six thousand years almost without interruption. However, though it's 
definitely worth the journey, Pella can appear rather underwhelming to non-
archeologists, with - in effect - little more than three ruined Byzantine 
churches to divert attention from the beautiful hill-walking all around. 
Nonetheless, it's a beautiful spot, and makes a pleasant stop on a journey 
along the Jordan Valley.
Some history
The reasons for Pella's long history have much to do with its location on 
the junction of major trade routes: north-south between Arabia and Syria, 
and east-west between the Transjordanian interior and the Mediterranean 
coast. With its positioning almost exactly at sea level - the Jordan Valley 
yawns below - Pella has a comfortably warm climate and is watered both 
by the gushing springs in the bed of the Wadi Jirm and by a reasonable 
annual rainfall. In addition, it was surrounded in antiquity by thick oak 
forests, since felled, which at more than one point provided the backbone 
of the city's economy.
From artefacts discovered near Pella, it seems that Stone Age hunters roamed 
the area's forests and savannahs up to about a million years ago, bagging native 
game such as elephants, deer and lions. By five thousand years ago, a Neolithic

farming village was spread out above the springs in the main Wadi Jirm, and 
remains have been uncovered of a larger, terraced Chalcolithic settlement 
just below Jebel Sartaba, southeast of the tell. By the early third millennium 
BC, during the Bronze Age, there was a thriving city at Pella, extensive 
evidence of which has been excavated from the tell: pieces dating from at least 
four main periods of occupation around the sixteenth and fifteenth centuries 
BC include luxury items imported from Egypt, Syria and Cyprus - indicating 
well-established trade links - such as bronze pins, stylized sculpture, gold thread, 
alabaster bottles, cuneiform clay tablets and beautiful inlaid ivory boxes. In the 
thirteenth century BC, Pella was the principal supplier to Pharaonic Egypt of 
wood for chariot spokes. Iron Age cities flourished on the tell up to the seventh 
century BC, but during the Persian period (539-332 BC) it seems that the area 
was abandoned.
The Hellenistic period is the first for which the name of Pella can be attested 
from historical records, and was a time of considerable affluence for the city. In 
218 BC, the Seleucid king Antiochus captured Pella on a sweep through 
Palestine and Transjordan, and thereafter occupation of the site spread over the 
tell, the slopes of Tell Husn opposite, the so-called "Civic Complex" area on the 
valley floor and the peak of Jebel Sartaba.
In 83 BC, the Jewish Hasmonean leader Alexander Jannaeus crossed into 
Transjordan from Palestine and sacked pagan Pella and its neighbours Gadara, 
Gerasa and others. The arrival twenty years later of Pompey and the Roman
army imposed order in Pella as elsewhere in the Decapolis region, and the city 
settled down to a period of stability, minting its own coins and embarking on a 
programme of building. However, one legacy of the city's location above a 
perpetually flowing spring is that, due to a rise in alluvium levels, it's been 
impossible to excavate in the valley bed. Consequently, virtually nothing of the 
Roman period apart from a small theatre survives, although coins found here 
depict a nymphaeum, various temples, probably a forum, a baths and lavish 
public buildings dotted throughout the city.
A massacre of twenty thousand Jews in a single hour at Caesarea in 
Palestine in 66 AD fuelled a widespread Jewish revolt against Roman rule, 
and amid the turmoil the nascent Christian community of Jerusalem fled 
en masse to the relative safety of Pella - though they returned by the time 
of the rebuilding of Jerusalem, around 130 AD. Pella reached its zenith 
during the Byzantine fifth and sixth centuries, with churches, houses and 
shops covering the slopes of the tell and Tell Husn, and pottery from North 
Africa and Asia Minor indicating significant international trade. However, by 
the seventh century, the city was again in decline; in 635, Muslim forces 
defeated the Byzantine army near Pella, and the city reverted to its pre-
Hellenistic Semitic name of Fahl. The devastating earthquake of 749 
destroyed most of Pella's standing structures, and the city lay abandoned for 
several centuries, small groups of farmers coming and going throughout the 
Abbasid and Mamluke periods.
The site
Although there may not be much romance left to Pella, it's certainly in a 
beautiful location. Sweet spring water cascades out of the ground on the floor 
of the Wadi Jirm; and the imposing bulk of the sheer Tell Husn to one side, 
the long, low tell on the other and Jebel Abu al-Khas between them (on 
which stands the modern, triple-arched Resthouse) enclose the little valley with 
high slopes of green, leaving only the vista westwards over the Jordan Valley. The 
abundant spring water, however, has proved irresistible to modern agriculture, 
JERASH AND THE NORTH | The northern Jordan Valley

and 100m beyond the antiquities stands a pumping station serving a lush area 
of irrigated farmland. Constantly chugging machinery and a reek of agrichemicals
make for an annoying accompaniment to a visit.
Before you reach the main site, you'll see the remains of the West Church
behind barbed wire on the edge of the modern village. The church was built 
in the late fifth or early sixth centuries, in Pella's prime, and is one of the 
largest Byzantine churches uncovered in the entire Middle East. The main 
valley is dominated by the standing columns of the Civic Complex Church
on the edge of the bubbling spring. All the re-erected columns belong to the 
church's atrium; to the east, in front of a finely paved portico, are two 
exquisite columns of green swirling marble, one of which cracked in two as 
it fell in antiquity. The church itself, its columns collapsed like a house of 
cards, has three apses, and was originally decorated with glass windows, glass 
mosaic half-domes, stone mosaics on the walls and floor, and chancel screens 
of marble. The monumental staircase in front was added in the seventh 
century, when the valley floor was some two to three metres below its current 
level. To one side of the church is the bowl of a small Roman theatre, built 
in the first century AD to seat about four hundred; many of its stones were 
plundered to build the church staircase. Across the whole area of the modern 
springs, there may once have stretched a forum, with the stream channelled 
below through subterranean vaulting, some of which is still visible.
The tell itself - on the left as you face the Resthouse - is likely to excite only 
archeologists. Although several different excavations have revealed dozens of 
levels of occupation over millennia, all there is to see for the layperson are the 
crisscrossing foundations of coarser and finer walls at different levels and a 
couple of re-erected columns. Of most accessible interest is a small Mamluke 
mosque close to the modern dig-house, with a plaque commemorating the 
decisive Battle of Fahl of 635. Excavations alongside it have unearthed the 
massive stone blocks of a Canaanite temple dating to 1480 BC, the largest yet 
discovered from that period. You'd have to be very keen to scale the precipitous 
Tell Husn opposite in order to poke around the sixth-century Byzantine 
fortress on its summit.
The steep path between the Civic Complex ruins and the Resthouse coils 
up the hillside past the columns of the small, atmospheric East Church, 
built in the fifth century overlooking the lower city and originally accessed 
by a monumental staircase from below. The atrium has a small pool in 
the centre.
Behind the Resthouse, Jordanian architect Ammar Khammash has built the 
private Pella Museum (Wwww.pellamuseum.org). It explores Jordan's history 
before archeology, showcasing fossils and exploring geological formations. 
Admission is by appointment only; the website has contact information, or ask 
at the Resthouse.
Practicalities
The ruins of Pella are situated close to the modern village of TABQAT FAHL, 
about 2km up a steep hill from the town of Mshare'a on the valley-floor 
highway. One or two buses run direct to Tabqat Fahl village from Irbid's Valleys 
station, but there are much more frequent departures from Irbid to Mshare'a, 
from where it's not difficult to hitch or even hike up the hill.
About 1km beyond the entrance gate to the site, on the hillside of Jebel Abu 
al-Khas, is the wonderfully cool and shady Pella Resthouse (T079 557 4145, 
Wwww.romero-jordan.com; daily 8am-sunset). This oasis of a place, designed 
by Ammar Khammash with a spectacular terrace perched high above the ruins,

Jordan's people
Although Jordan has a relatively homogeneous population, 
Jordanian society is nonetheless characterized by overlapping 
layers of identity: the country's 6.2 million people share much 
of the ethnic, religious and social mix of the wider Middle East, 
overlaid with a widespread, and often strong, tribal identity. 
Throughout the country you'll encounter articulate, worldly 
outlooks peppered with expressions of religious and social 
sensibility that sound refreshingly unfamiliar to Western ears.

Ethnicity
Almost Jordan's entire population is 
Arab. This is an ethnic term, but also 
marks a pan-national identity, largely 
because nation-states are a relatively 
recent arrival in the region: many 
people in Jordan feel a much stronger 
cultural affinity with Arabs from nearby 
countries than, say, Britons might 
feel with Belgians. The bedouin (see 
overleaf) add a deeper layer of meaning 
by often regarding themselves to be the 
only true, original Arabs. Jordan has 
tiny ethnic minorities of Circassians
and Chechens (who are Muslim), 
Armenians (Christian) and Kurds
(Muslim) - all of whom are closely 
bound into Jordanian society - as well 
as Dom gypsies (Muslim).
Religion
Roughly 92 percent of Jordanians are 
Sunni Muslim, and though the big 
cities - chiefly Amman and Aqaba - 
show a modestly secular influence in 
parts, the observance of Islam is a 
central part of daily life for most people 
across Jordan. The call to prayer sounds 
five times a day in every city, town and 
village. 
Jordan's largest religious minority, 
totalling around six percent, are the 
various denominations of Christians, 
most of whom are Greek Orthodox, 
but also including Melkite Catholics, 
Roman Catholics, Syrian Orthodox, 
Armenian Orthodox, Coptic Orthodox, 
Maronites 
and 
some 
Protestants 
(Lutherans, 
Baptists, 
Episcopalians 
and others). There are also small 
communities of Shia Muslims, Druze
and Bahai. Expats aside, there are no 
Jews in Jordan.

Nationality
There persists in some quarters a 
perceived difference between people 
whose origins lie in families long 
resident on the east bank of the River 
Jordan, and people whose families 
originate on the west bank of the 
river. All are Jordanian citizens, yet 
Jordanians of Palestinian origin are 
estimated to number between half and 
three-quarters of the total population. 
Roughly seven percent are expats, 
including guest workers - many of them 
Egyptian, Sri Lankan and Filipino - 
alongside a sizeable population of Iraqi
refugees.
Tribe
A tribe is an extended grouping of 
families who cultivate a distinctive 
tradition of history and folklore (mainly 
oral) and assert ownership of a particular 
territory. 
Three of Jordan's many tribes are the 
Rualla in the east, the Bani Sakhr
in the centre and the Howeitat in 
the south. Not all tribes are desert-
dwelling - there are many whose 
background is rural - and tribal 
territories, which predate nation-
states, often extend across international 
borders. Some tribes are made up of 
clans and branches which have taken 
on tribe-like status, others have banded 
together in larger, often pan-national, 
tribal confederations. All of these 
concepts are rather loose. For a lot of 
Jordanians, though, tribal identity is at 
least as strong as religious or national 
identity. 
See p.397 for an article examining 
some issues of tribal culture.

The next generation
Like many countries across the Middle 
East, Jordan has a young population:
more than a third of Jordanians are 
under the age of 15. This is also one 
of the best-educated countries in the 
developing world. Almost everyone 
you come across will be able to hold 
some sort of conversation in English 
(and possibly in French, Spanish and 
German as well), and if you make a 
point of visiting, say, Jordan University 
in Amman or Yarmouk University in 
Irbid, you'll see students from all income 
groups and social backgrounds mixing 
freely. The traditional emphasis on 
engineering and the sciences is giving 
way to new technology and even 
ﬁlmmaking: Aqaba's Red Sea Institute 
of Cinematic Arts, backed by Steven 
Spielberg, is turning out directors 
and cinematographers of world-class 
standard. The heritage-style image of 
Jordan as a nation of simple tent-
dwellers, scratching a living from the 
desert sands, is just part of the story.
Bedouin and fellahin
Within tribal identity, many people make a 
distinction in Jordan - as in other Middle 
Eastern countries - between two broad 
social traditions. The bedouin originate in 
families who are current or former desert-
dwellers: they may once have been nomadic, 
but are almost all now settled. Some still live 
in tents in the desert or the desert margins, 
following traditional lifestyles, but many 
do not: a police officer in Amman or a 
marketing executive in Aqaba might be as 
bedouin as a camel-guide in Wadi Rum. 
By contrast the fellahin originate from a 
settled, rural, farming tradition, often in the 
north and west of Jordan. They frequently 
have strong historic links - often of family 
or tribe - to rural communities across the 
borders in Syria and Palestine.

is worth a visit on its own merits. Its fresh-squeezed juices and cold beers are 
an obvious attraction in a place as sultry as Pella, but the main draw is a plate 
of the best and freshest fish in Jordan, plucked daily from the river and served 
up with mezze for under JD10 (their grilled chicken is a succulent alternative). 
An accompanying bottle of chilled white wine might persuade you to leave 
ruin-hunting in the hot sun until next time.
The friendly, English-speaking Resthouse manager, Deeb Hussein - whose 
family have been in the area since 1885 - operates the only place to stay, the 
small but highly recommended A Pella Countryside Hotel, set among peaceful 
olive groves on the edge of Tabqat Fahl (T079 557 4145 or 077 618 4337, 
Edheebjawahreh575@hotmail.com; 3 inc. half-board). Its modest en-suite 
rooms (with a/c) are simple but comfortable and very clean, with the appeal of 
genuine hospitality and an excellent dinner and breakfast.
Around Pella
Longer exploration of the area around Pella can take the form of a combina-
tion of ruin-hunting and adventure hiking - but you should definitely discuss 
your plans first with the Resthouse manager, who knows both the history and 
the topography of the area intimately. If you head past the East Church to 
curve up behind the Resthouse, you'll find rough trails leading across the hills 
for an hour or more out to the peak of Jebel Sartaba; here stands a Hellenistic 
fortress, rather less dramatic in itself than the remoteness of the location and 
the stunning views across the hills and valleys west into Israel and Palestine and 
east towards Ajloun.
Kahf il-Messih
Equally explorable is the route by car or on foot northwards into the hills to a 
little-explored site known as Kahf il-Messih, or the Jesus Cave. Access is 
straight along the approach road from the Jordan Valley (instead of taking the 
side-turn up to the Resthouse); the road is rocky and bad, but taken slowly is 
passable in an ordinary car.
Some 200m beyond the Resthouse junction is a fork; straight on, after 
1.6km, you'll arrive at a highly photogenic rock arch through which flows 
the warm Wadi Hemmeh. Circle around to view it from the other side, 
where you'll also spot a small building which once housed the hot spring 
itself, now reduced to a stagnant pool. Back at the fork, the other road heads 
uphill for 2.4km; turn right here, then continue on, ignoring small roads 
which join from the side. After 7.3km, in the middle of the village of Kufr 
Rakib, take the right fork. As you leave the village, beneath the twin arches, 
take the right fork again, then a small road on the right after 1km, and left 
after another 1.3km into the locality of Bayt Eidiss. About 300m further is 
a spreading oak tree, marking the site of the Jesus Cave, with its arched 
entrance facing north. Local legend - thoroughly unsubstantiated - has it 
that Jesus stayed in the cave for some days before going to meet John for his 
baptism. It has Roman-style loculi, or alcoves for bodies, cut side-by-side into 
the bedrock. The oak tree is also the object of some veneration by the locals. 
Beside it is a flat rectangular area for treading grapes, complete with rock-cut 
channels and pools for collecting the juice.
The rolling hills all around are beautiful and quiet, many of them laced with 
extensive networks of caves and dotted with the odd archeological ruin (a small 
mosaic-floored church has been unearthed on one of the hills opposite). The 
village of Kufr Abil, a stop on the long walk between Ajloun and Pella (see 
p.169), is only a few kilometres south of here.

signposted 4km further north. Buses from Amman and Irbid use the bridge on 
their way to and from Tel Aviv and Nazareth (see p.000), but it's also possible to 
cross independently (see p.000). A taxi from the bridge to Irbid is about JD25,

The eastern desert
F
or hundreds of kilometres east of Amman, the stony Eastern Desert 
plains extend unbroken to the Iraqi border - and beyond, clear to 
Baghdad. This is the harshest and least populated part of Jordan, with a 
bare handful of roads linking small, dusty towns and frontier villages. The 
two exceptions are Zarqa, an industrial city and transport hub, and Mafraq, 
amiable but remote-feeling capital of the northeast. East of Mafraq, in the black 
basalt desert hugging the Syrian border, sit the stark ruins of Umm al-Jimal, 
enormously romantic in the cool evening.
However, the main reason to come out here is to follow the "Desert 
Castles loop", a circuit of desert roads that runs past a string of early-Islamic 
inns and hunting lodges, collectively dubbed the "Desert Castles". For its 
mosaics and its remote atmosphere, newly restored Qasr Hallabat is one of 
the best, matched by elegant Qasr Harraneh and the uniquely frescoed 
Qusayr Amra.
At the circuit's farthest point, 100km east of Amman, lie the castle and twin 
villages of Azraq, Lawrence of Arabia's desert headquarters, set in a once-
majestic oasis in the heart of the eastern Badia, which stretches from the 
populated central belt of the country east and north to the Syrian and Iraqi 
borders. Nearby the unremarkable town of Safawi gives access to a host of 
Ideas for exploring eastern Jordan
Of all Jordan's regions, the east is most under-visited. Few tourists bother to come 
out here - but even if you're relying on public transport, it's easy to construct a 
one-night tour: start with a bus from Amman to Zarqa, head east to Qasr Hallabat
(p.196), then continue to Azraq (p.202). Next day return to Zarqa and switch buses 
for Mafraq and then Umm al-Jimal (p.192), before returning from Mafraq to Amman 
or Jerash.
Renting a car (see p.39) buys you the freedom to roam at your own pace, opening 
up sites such as Harraneh and Amra that have no public transport access. If that 
doesn't appeal, many of Amman's budget hotels offer competitively priced one-day 
trips by taxi to Harraneh, Amra and Azraq; for more, see p.195.
To add a twist of adventure, talk to the Royal Society for the Conservation of 
Nature (RSCN; see p.51) about ﬁxing up a half- or full-day excursion from Azraq 
- maybe an off-road tour of nearby sites such as Aseikhim (p.214) and Biqyaw-
iyya (p.213), or birdwatching at dawn in the wetlands nature reserve (p.208). 
They can also arrange trips to far-ﬂung desert locations, including Jawa (p.213) 
and Burqu (p.215).

190
desert attractions, including the holy tree of Biqya'wiyya and the spectacular 
Qasr Burqu, a ruined black castle on the shores of a mirage-like lake, which 
lies remote in the far desert, just 50km from the Iraqi border.
Transport practicalities
Public transport in the desert is predictably thin. From Amman, take a bus to 
either Zarqa - from where buses head to Azraq (via Hallabat) - or Mafraq, for 
buses to Umm al-Jimal and the desert towns further east. For information on 
transport options around the "Desert Castles loop", turn to p.195.
Zarqa and around
Some 20km northeast of Downtown Amman, and connected to the capital by 
a ribbon of low-income suburbs, industrial ZARQA is Jordan's second-largest 
city. There's little reason to spend time here except to catch an onward bus - to

nearby Khirbet as-Samra, with its Roman-Byzantine ruins; Hallabat, at the 
start of the "Desert Castles" loop; or direct to Azraq.
Zarqa has two bus stations, 1km apart, within walking distance of the central 
clock tower. The New Station serves Amman - either Tabarbour or Mahatta 
stations - as well as Madaba and elsewhere. A shuttle bus runs from here to the 
Old Station, or you could walk left on the main road under the canopy for 
500m and then aim for the clock tower. Useful bus routes from the Old Station 
include to Azraq, Hallabat, Khirbet as-Samra, Mafraq and Jerash.
Khirbet as-Samra
If time is spare, you might take a couple of hours to visit isolated KHIRBET
AS-SAMRA, about 20km northeast of Zarqa. Decked in wildflowers in spring 
and baked brown in summer, these hills were once crossed by caravans travelling 
the Roman Via Nova Traiana, and the town - then named Hattita - flourished 
for five hundred years or more. A Roman cohort was garrisoned here during 
the fourth century, and archeologists have uncovered eight Byzantine churches, 
all with mosaic floors.

Unfortunately, Hattita is better in the telling than the seeing: all the mosaics have 
either been removed or covered over for safekeeping and it's hard to make sense 
of the site. The sense of countrified isolation is as good a reason as any to visit. 
(Khirbet as-Samra is best known in Jordan for its huge wastewater treatment plant, 
but fortunately this isn't in sight or smell of the old village.) Walking around the 
ruins will bring you to a large reservoir, near which is the Church of St John, a 
tiny place identifiable by its white limestone (instead of the otherwise ubiquitous 
black basalt) and paved floor, complete with apse. Further on are the foundations 
of the west wall of the original Roman fort, traceable around to the exposed East 
Gate, with the threshold and bases of flanking twin towers visible. The site 
guardian will help guide you around and show you photos from the French team 
(Wwww.afasr.org) who excavate here; he deserves a tip.
Buses run from Zarqa, or you could drive: turn right 4km past Zarqa's clock 
tower to Hashmiyya, then right again after another 13km. You'll see the ruins 
after 6km.
Mafraq and around
Roughly 70km north of Amman - and just 12km south of the Syrian border - 
lies the ramshackle town of MAFRAQ. Squeezed between it and the Jordan 
Valley to the west is the whole of the northern Jordanian agricultural and indus-
trial heartland, but to the east yawns the open desert, and Mafraq's mood is of 
a tussle with the elements scarcely won. Dust fills the long streets, the buildings 
are squat and ranged close together; many people wear the billowing robes of 
desert dwellers. Close by in southern Syria, and often visible, is the extinct 
volcano of Jebel Druze, rising to 1800m and surrounded for hundreds of 
kilometres by blisteringly hot plains of basaltic lava known as the Hawran. 
Near Mafraq irrigated fields temper the monotony, but further east - and south 
as far as Azraq - the desert is shadowy and grimly blackish, stark bedrock 
overlaid by dark boulders and glassy basalt chips too hot to touch.
Mafraq has nothing much to tempt, but it's a staging-post for journeys east 
and has two bus stations, 1.5km apart. Buses from Amman (Tabarbour) and 
Zarqa come into the Bedouin station, so called because it serves mostly desert 
destinations, including Umm al-Jimal, Dayr al-Kahf, Safawi and Ruwayshid. 
Local serveeces shuttle to the Fellahin station, from where buses head out to 
agricultural destinations including Irbid (which lies 45km northwest on a fast 
road) and Jerash. Town life is centred on the Fellahin station, with shops and 
cafés in surrounding streets often bustling with students from Mafraq's Al al-
Bayt University.
Umm al-Jimal
In 1913, the American archeologist H.C. Butler wrote: "Far out in the desert 
there is a deserted city all of basalt, [rising] black and forbidding from the grey 
of the plain." The romance and sense of discovery accompanying a visit to 
UMM AL-JIMAL (literally "Mother of Camels") still holds true, even though 
the plain is now irrigated, and a modern village with good roads has grown up 
around the ruins. The site has been well excavated and is rewarding to explore 
- you could spend a couple of hours here, though the sun can be fierce: bring 
water, and plan to visit before noon or after 3pm.
Umm al-Jimal was occupied for seven hundred years up to about 750 AD. 
Following Queen Zenobia of Palmyra's rebellion against Rome in the third

century, the village was rebuilt as a military station on the fortified frontier of 
the Roman Empire. It prospered as an agricultural and commercial centre; a 
sixth-century conversion to Christianity resulted in fifteen churches going up. 
However, an onslaught of plague, war, the Muslim conquest and a massive 
earthquake led to the town's abandonment.
Umm al-Jimal's appeal lies in its ordinariness. Although it is roughly contem-
porary with the grand city of Jerash, only a day's ride westward, Umm al-Jimal 
has no temples or impressive monumental buildings. There's not even any 
evidence of the town's original Roman name, which remains unknown. The 
archeologist who excavated the ruins, Bert de Vries, perceptively explained 
Umm al-Jimal as "a symbol of the real life of Rome's subjects".

The bus can drop you at a point where the modern road cuts through Umm 
al-Jimal's ancient town walls. Start a one- or two-hour walking tour at the 
nearby barracks, dating from the fifth century. In the eastern wall the basalt

slab door, which still moves on its hinges, gives onto a courtyard. The late 
Byzantine corner tower is inscribed with crosses and the names of the four 
archangels: Gabriel, Raphael, Michael and Uriel.
Picking a path between Houses 102 and 116, and left around House 104 
(see map, p.193), will deliver you to the double church, two adjacent 
basilicas tucked into the houses around them, fronted by a small ablutions 
basin. Nearby House XVI's lockable double doors would have fitted 
together snugly, and inside is a good example of a corbelled ceiling, the 
strong basalt beams supporting a much greater load than limestone could. 
Back behind you, the sheikh's house is outside on the left. Its large internal 
courtyard has a cantilevered staircase on the left and two in front forming a 
V-shape; stables were ranged at ground level, with bedrooms above. If you 
leave the courtyard through the gate here, you'll spot a beautiful double-
arched window three storeys up.
From here, wandering north through the loose, clinking basalt leads to a huge 
reservoir - now fenced off - that was originally Roman. Just west of the 
reservoir, a scramble through House 82 brings you into House XIII, with 
mangers and an interlocking stone ventilation screen - partially obscured by a 
recently built arch - dividing space for livestock within the house.
It's a 150-metre walk across to the four graceful and strikingly silhouetted 
arches of the West Church. The structure that remains is the division 
between the nave and a side-aisle; beautiful Byzantine crosses are carved on 
the arches. A little way south the cathedral sports a reused lintel stone 
mentioning Valens, Valentinian and Gratian, co-emperors in 371 AD. Close by 
is the praetorium, with a triple doorway. One of the rooms nearby has 
strings of barbed wire across its entrances and is often used to pen a herd of 
beautiful white camels belonging to the local sheikh. From here, your starting 
point at the Barracks is nearby.
Roman enthusiasts could drive to see a well-preserved stretch of the Via

Umm al-Jimal to the West Church and fork left; after 7km, a left turn at a 
T-junction, right at a small roundabout and straight on at a bigger roundabout 
will bring you after 600m to the cambered Roman road, pointing across the 
fields north (right) towards Bosra and south (left) towards Amman.
The "Desert Castles" loop
For most visitors, the main reason to head east is to explore Jordan's "Desert 
Castles", a group of early-Islamic buildings dotted around the desert - the best 
of which are now easily accessible by ordinary vehicles driving on proper roads. 
Most date from the seventh century, when the Umayyad dynasty was ruling 
from Damascus: bedouin at heart, the Umayyad caliphs seem to have needed an 
escape from the pressures of city life, and so built a network of hunting lodges, 
caravanserais and farmhouses to serve as rural retreats. Nineteenth-century 
archeologists came up with the term "Desert Castles" - yet few of the buildings 
are true castles, and many were built on what was then semi-fertile agricultural 
land. Archeologists have suggested replacement titles - desert complexes, 
country estates, farmsteads - but none exactly fits the bill.
These are some of Jordan's most atmospheric ancient buildings - most notably 
Qasr Harraneh and Qusayr Amra, which lie near each other on a fast road 
between Amman and the oasis town of Azraq (itself worth a stop for its nature 
reserve, eco-friendly lodge and links to Lawrence of Arabia; see p.202). A 
different road to Azraq, from the city of Zarqa, passes by the well-restored 
fortress of Qasr Hallabat, making it easy to follow a loop in either direction 
from Amman.
Harder-to-reach sites in the area include the ruined Qasr Mushatta, near 
Amman's airport, and Qasr Tuba, marooned in the roadless desert south 
of Harraneh.
Transport practicalities
Transport options around the "Desert Castles loop" - which starts and 
finishes in Amman, with Azraq as its furthest point - are limited, since two 
of the best sites (Harraneh and Amra) are inaccessible by public transport. 
You could cobble the route together with a combination of buses and paid 
hitching, but many travellers opt instead to join "tours" run by several of 
Amman's budget hotels, notably the Farah, Cliff and Palace (book at least one 
day ahead; contact details on p.92). For around 18-20JD per person (with a 
minimum of, usually, three people to make the trip viable), you get door-to-
door transport to Harraneh, Amra, Azraq and back, with waiting time at each; 
sometimes Hallabat is included (if it isn't, try and get it added to the 
itinerary), but lunch is not. This is the cheapest and easiest way to see the 
loop in a day: you're unlikely to get a better price if you negotiate directly 
with a taxi-driver in Amman, who may not know the route anyway. However, 
if there are two or more of you, you'll save money - and gain in convenience 
- by renting a car (see p.39) and driving yourself: directions are given in 
each account below.
Although Qasr Burqu (p.215) and Qasr Tuba (p.201) can be grouped archeo-
logically with the sites on the loop, they are so far off any beaten tracks that it's 
There's a map of the area on p.190.

only possible to reach them with a local guide and a 4x4 vehicle, best booked 
through an adventure tour operator with expert knowledge; the RSCN (see 
p.51) is a good first point of contact.
Qasr Hallabat
QASR HALLABAT (daily 8am-6pm; winter closes 4pm), perfectly situated 
on a small hill 30km northeast of Zarqa, is one of the most elaborate of the 
"Desert Castles". A Roman fort was built in black basalt on this site in the 
second century to guard the Azraq road, and parts of it still survive, but much 
of the building dates from an eighth-century Umayyad restoration in contrasting 
white limestone, when a mosque was added and mosaic floors laid. A Spanish 
archeological team has done extensive work here in recent years, clearing much 
rubble and bringing order to the site. It is now perhaps the most satisfying of 
all the Desert Castles to explore, full of desert atmosphere - and, for now, still 
largely unvisited.
If you're driving, follow Hashmi Street east from Downtown Amman direct 
to the Zarqa clock tower; 22km further, in Dulayl, turn right and Hallabat is 
7km ahead. Coming from Azraq, Hallabat lies 53km along the road signed for 
Zarqa. Hallabat village has two separate halves - Hallabat al-Gharbi (West) and 
Hallabat ash-Sharqi (East). Buses from Zarqa drop off in Gharbi, near the site's 
Visitor Centre. Admission is currently free, but a small charge may be imposed 
in future.
From the Visitor Centre it's a walk of 200m up a stony path to the hilltop site, 
where the guardian will emerge to escort you. You come first to the beautifully 
rebuilt Umayyad mosque, many of its doorway arches sporting distinctive 
scalloping. Alongside, a modern door beneath a wobbly entrance arch - one 
shake and it'd be rubble - leads into the main building's spacious, stone-flagged 
courtyard, in an L-shaped layout and flanked in black and white. To left and 
right, tall basalt walls lead into rooms filled with reused blocks inscribed in 
Greek; in several places you can see remnants of the original herringbone-
patterned plaster. A scramble to the corner towers - the highest points of the 
ruins - can help with orientation; from here, as well as panoramic views over 
the undulating desert hills, you can spot older blocks from the tiny original 
Roman fort which occupied one corner of the site. Opposite, a water channel 
runs under the stairs, carrying rainwater from the roof to cisterns under the 
courtyard and outside the walls. Filling the centre of the building is a large 
square room complete with a dazzling carpet mosaic in a diamond design; the 
adjacent portico also features mosaics of birds and fish.
Hammam as-Srah
Roughly 3km east, in Hallabat ash-Sharqi, lies a small Umayyad bath-house, 
HAMMAM AS-SRAH, currently under restoration. Similar to, though 
smaller than, Qusayr Amra, its caldarium (hot room) is nearest the road, followed 
by the tepidarium (warm room) with the hypocaust system of underfloor heating

and terracotta flues in the walls. The apodyterium (changing room) is furthest 
away, next to the original entrance, where there's some decorative cross-
hatching on the walls.
If you're facing the building, there's a minor T-junction 300m to the left. 
At this junction turn right and continue for 2km to reach the main Zarqa-
Azraq road.
From Hallabat, the main road runs east for 53km to Azraq (see p.202).
Qasr Mushatta
The largest of the "Desert Castles", QASR MUSHATTA (Arabic for "Winter 
Palace") lies southeast of Amman, just beyond the north runway of Queen Alia 
Airport - clearly visible on both takeoff and landing.
It probably dates from the 740s and is moderately well preserved, although it 
was never finished. The site is enclosed by a square wall 144m along each side, 
with collapsed towers all round and portions of intricate classical-style carving
surviving. Similar pieces at one time covered all of the exterior, but as a sop to 
Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany before World War I, the Ottoman sultan Abdul 
Hamid II had most of them stripped off and presented to the Pergamon 
Museum in Berlin, where they are still on display. The whole site is littered with 
unfinished work, capitals and column drums; along with the carving, everything 
hints at a splendour of design that was never fully realized.
To get there, drive south out of Amman on the airport highway. Exactly 
6.5km past the Madaba exit look for a small white mosque on the northbound 
(left-hand) side of the highway, followed 200m later (also on the northbound 
side) by a minor turn-off. This is the road you want. Continue south until you 
can make a U-turn, then return northbound and turn right down the turn-off. 
Keep straight, following Air Cargo signs past industrial estates and across the old 
Hejaz Railway tracks. After 7.4km, just before a checkpoint, you'll see the 
ruined palace on the left.
As you walk in, remnants of a mosque lie to the right, its mihrab set into the 
external wall. The palace buildings themselves are massive, built of unusual burnt 
brick above a stone base. The triple-arched entrance hall has a colonnade of 
beautiful swirling greenish marble columns, very striking against the reddish 
brick. Ahead is the huge triple-apsed reception hall. All around are intercon-
nected rooms, some still with their high, barrel-vaulted ceilings in place; if you 
decide to explore, tread heavily to warn any resident snakes of your presence. 
Behind the impressive arched iwans, at the back of the hall on both sides, ancient 
toilets stick out of the wall, complete with run-off drain.
Qasr Harraneh (Qasr Kharana)
Most "Desert Castles" tours from Amman follow the loop anticlockwise onto the 
Azraq road, which begins from Sahab, a southern district of the capital. Drive 
south out of Downtown Amman along Prince Hassan Street (aka Madaba St) 
through Wihdat. In industrial Sahab, about 5km south of the major intersection 
Middle East Circle (duwaar ash-sharq al-awsat), you'll come to the flyover which 
carries the road from Azraq. Head left (east) on this road, beyond the factories and 
into the sandy-coloured desert. About 17km on, hilltop MUWAQQAR village 
is a terminus for buses from Amman's Mahatta station and also hosts a large 
Umayyad reservoir, dating from the early 720s AD and still in use.
THE EASTERN DESERT | The "Desert Castles" loop

Beyond Muwaqqar, it's a straight run for 38km east to QASR HARRANEH
(often signposted wrongly in English and/or Arabic as "Kharaneh" or 
"Kharana").
Of all the sites in the eastern desert, Harraneh - whose name derives from the 
stony harra desert in which it sits - was probably the one which gave rise to the 
misnomer "Desert Castles". Standing foursquare beside the road, and visible for 
miles around, it looks like a fortress built for defensive purposes, with round 
corner towers, arrow slits in the wall and a single, defendable entrance. However, 
on closer examination, you'll find that Harraneh's towers are solid (and thus 
unmannable) and that only three-metre giants with extra-long arms could fire 
anything out of the arrow slits. Rather, it seems most likely that Harraneh - 
positioned at the meeting point of many desert tracks - was a kind of country 
conference centre, used by the Umayyad caliphs as a comfortable and accessible 
place to meet with local bedouin leaders, or even as a site where the bedouin 
themselves could meet on neutral ground to iron out tribal differences. It was 
probably built in the late seventh century; a few lines of graffiti in an upper 
room were written on November 24, 710.
The site
Marvellously cool and perfectly still inside, Harraneh (daily 8am-6pm; winter 
closes 4pm; joint ticket with Amra and Azraq JD1) is one of Jordan's most 
atmospheric and beautiful ancient buildings. Soak up the peace and quiet for an 
hour or two.
Circle left around the building to reach the sunken Visitor Centre at the back 
of the site. From here, you approach the main entrance facade head-on. Look 
up to see a distinctive band of diagonal bricks up near the top of the walls, a 
decorative device still in use on garden walls all over Jordan today.
As you enter the qasr, to left and right are long, dark rooms probably used as 
stables. The courtyard is surprisingly small, and it's here you realize how 
deceptive the solid exterior is: the whole building is only 35m square, but its 
doughty towers and soaring entrance make it seem much bigger. An arched 
portico originally ran round the courtyard, providing shade below and a 
corridor above - when it was in place, virtually no direct sunlight could 
penetrate into the interior. All the rooms round the courtyard, including those 
upstairs, are divided into self-contained units, each called a bayt, comprising a 
large central room with smaller rooms opening off it. This is typically Umayyad, 
and the same system was used in the palace at Amman, as well as at Mushatta 
and Tuba. Weaving in and out, you can explore your way around the deliciously 
musty and cool ground floor to get a sense of how the maze-like bayt system 
works. Each bayt most likely held a single delegation - the central, well-lit room 
used for meetings or socializing, the flanking, darker rooms for sleeping or 
storage. Harraneh had space for a total of eight delegations and their horses.
Of the two staircases, the left-hand one as you came in delivers you to the 
more interesting upper western rooms; at the top of the stairs, it's easy to see 
the springs of the portico arches below. The room immediately to your left 
upstairs is lined with stone rosettes. Next door, a more ornate room holds a 
few lines of eighth-century graffiti, in black painted Kufic script in the far 
left-hand corner above a doorway. All around are graceful blind arcades and 
friezes of rosettes, with the semi-domed ceiling supported on squinches.
The northern bayts, which are open to the sky, give onto the large east
room, with a simple houndstooth design. From the southeast corner there's a 
nice view along the whole width of the qasr through alternately lit and dark 
areas. The southern room, with a row of little arched windows over the 
THE EASTERN DESERT | The "Desert Castles" loop

199
courtyard, has the only large window, looking out above the entrance: this may 
have been a watchpost. One of the small, dark rooms on the south wall has a 
unique cross-vaulted ceiling, with decorated squares and diamonds not found 
elsewhere. Take the stairs up again to the roof to watch the dustdevils spinning 
across the flat, stony plain.
Qusayr Amra
If you're not ready for it, you might miss the squat QUSAYR AMRA (daily 
8am-6pm; winter closes 4pm; joint ticket with Harraneh and Azraq JD1), 
beside the Amman-Azraq road 15km east of Harraneh. Qusayr is the diminutive 
of qasr, meaning "little castle" ("Qasr Amra" is also common). A small bath-
house, Amra was built to capitalize on the waters of the Wadi Butm, named after 
the butm (wild pistachio) trees which still form a ribbon of fertility winding 
through the desert, now arbitrarily cleft by the highway. A short walk in the 
wadi-bed beyond Amra can transport you within minutes into total silence 
among the trees.
Amra was where the Umayyad caliphs came to let their hair down, far from 
prying eyes in Damascus. Probably built between 711 and 715 by Caliph 
Walid I, it is unmissable for the extensive frescoes covering its interior walls. 
Joyously human, vivid and detailed, they stand in stark contrast to the 
windswept emptiness of the desert, and feature an earthly paradise of luscious 
fruits and vines, naked women, cupids, musicians, hunters and the kings of 
conquered lands. The first Islamic edict ordering the destruction of images 
came from one of Walid's successors, when Amra's frescoes were just five years

old, but for some reason they were overlooked and have managed to survive 
1300 years of fire and graffiti.
Alongside the parking area is a Visitor Centre which includes an interpreta-
tion room, with good information about the building and its history.
The site
As you approach the building, what you see first is the water supply system - a 
cistern, a deep well and the saqiya, or turning circle (an ox or a donkey went 
round and round this circle to draw water up from the well). The main door 
into the bath-house is opposite.
The main hall
The door opens southwards into the main hall, which is divided into three 
aisles; facing you at the back is a small suite of rooms probably reserved for the 
caliph. At first sight, the frescoes are disappointingly sparse, scratched with 
graffiti and - after the brightness of the desert sun - almost invisible. But if you 
wait a few minutes to let your eyes adjust, the frescoes become much easier to 
see, and much more rewarding to linger over.
On the sides of the arches facing you, setting the tone of the place, are a topless 
woman holding up a fish [e on the map] and a nude female dancer welcoming 
visitors [f]. Above the entrance is a woman on a bed [a], with figures by her side, 
a pensive woman reclining with a winged angel [b] and a female flautist, a male 
lute-player and a dancer [c], with another nude woman [d]. The central aisle 
that you're standing in mostly has real or fantasized scenes from court life: aside 
from women, there are horsemen, archers and people sitting and talking [g].
At the far end of the right-hand (west) aisle [o], a woman reclines on a golden 
couch beneath an awning, with a male attendant and a woman seated on the 
ground nearby; at the head of the couch is a bearded man who pops up in 
many of the murals and who, archeologists have surmised, might have been in 
charge of the bath-house. Above the figures are two peacocks and a Greek 
inscription referring to victory. Below is what looks like a walled city, and 
below that, a decorative geometric pattern runs at eye level around the room. 
Near the corner - and difficult to make out - are six kings [p], all conquered 
by Walid: the Byzantine emperor, the last Visigothic king of Spain, the Persian 
emperor, the king of Abyssinia and two others, now obscured (the king of India, 
the emperor of China or the Turkish khan). Next to them is a large and strik-
ingly clear nude female bather [q], surrounded by onlookers, one of whom 
is the bearded man; he's also watching male gymnastics [r]. Above, wild asses, 
their ears pricked, are being driven into nets. Round near the entrance are some 
grapes and fragments showing curled toes [s].
If you move into the suite at the back - sometimes called the throne room - 
you'll first see leopards [j] and fruit trees [k] decorating the side walls. On either 
side of where the throne might have stood are male and female figures - one, 
very pregnant, representing fertility [l]. Dominating the back wall is a seated 
king [h], possibly Walid; two attendants with fans or fly-whisks keep him happy 
and there's a frieze of partridges around his head. On either side are presumably 
royal withdrawing rooms, with mosaic floors [m] and murals of fat grapes, giant 
pomegranates, acanthus leaves and peaches or heart-shaped fruit [n].
Back in the main hall the east aisle has, near the entrance, a large leaf design 
[t] beside hunters killing and disembowelling asses inside huge nets [u]. The 
whole of the east wall is devoted to a hunting scene of saluki hounds chasing 
and capturing asses [v]. At the far end are the muses of History and Philosophy 
[w], alongside Poetry [x]. Dominating this aisle, though, are everyday scenes

overhead, depicting metalworkers, carpenters, blacksmiths, hod-carriers and 
jolly working camels.
The baths
The door in the east wall leads into the baths, which have a different style of 
decoration, probably the work of a different artist. The first room is thought to 
have been a changing room (apodyterium) or a cool room (frigidarium), originally 
floored in marble with benches on two sides. Above the door is a reclining 
woman, gazed on by a stubbled admirer and a cupid [A]. The south wall has a 
sequence of little figures in a diamond pattern, including a monkey [B]
applauding a bear playing the lute [C]. Opposite the door is a woman with a 
very 1960s hairdo [D]; next to her are a flautist [E] and a female dancer [F]. On 
the ceiling overhead, blackened by smoke, is a fine sequence showing the three 
ages of man, with the penetrating gaze of the same man in his 20s, 40s and 
60s. Next door is a tepidarium, with a plunge pool and a hypocaust system to 
allow warm air to circulate beneath the floor and up flues in the wall. Beside 
the door is a tableau of three nude women [G], one of them holding a child; if 
you follow the picture round to the right, a woman is pouring water [H] and 
is about to bathe the child [J].
The last room, a domed steam room, or caldarium, is next to the furnace; the 
holes in the wall all around supported marble wall slabs, and there are a couple 
of plunge pools. Above is the earliest surviving representation of the zodiac on 
a spherical surface [K]. Dead ahead you can easily identify Sagittarius, the 
centaur, with the tail of Scorpio to the left. Ophiuchus the serpent-holder is 
above Scorpio and below an upside-down, club-wielding Hercules. From 
Scorpio, follow the red band left to Gemini, the twins, and Orion. The whole 
map is centred on the North Star; just to the left of it is the Great Bear. Above 
and at right angles is the Little Bear, and twisting between the two is Draco, the 
snake. Just to the right, Cepheus is shrugging his shoulders, next to Andromeda 
with outspread arms. Cygnus the swan is just by Andromeda's left hand.
Next on the loop, 25km east of Amra, is Azraq (see p.202).
Qasr Tuba
Way off any road in the depths of the desert, about 110km southeast of 
Amman, QASR TUBA is the most southerly of the "Desert Castles", and, 
though ruined, is the only one which still has its original atmosphere of a 
grand estate reached after a long and difficult journey. To get there you need 
a 4x4 and a reliable guide - either a local villager or a nature or archeology 
specialist from Amman or Azraq. There are three possible access routes. Best 
known is the desert track heading due south 47km from Harraneh. A more 
difficult alternative leads 30km west from an unmarked point on the Azraq-
Jafr road (see p.205). Otherwise, from the Amman-Ma'an Desert Highway, 
about 14km north of Qatraneh (see p.317), a road branches east towards Tuba 
- but the tarmac runs out after 30km, leaving you to negotiate the last 40km 
or so across the stony desert. As you get close, keep an eye out for the barrel 
vaults of the buildings, visible from some way off on the south side of the 
Wadi al-Ghadaf.
Although remote today, Tuba was built to be a caravanserai on the route 
between Syria, Azraq and northern Arabia. It was begun around 743 AD, the 
same time as Mushatta, and in a similar style, with bricks built up on a stone 
THE EASTERN DESERT | The "Desert Castles" loop

foundation. Tuba's bricks, though, are of sun-baked mud, unique among the 
Desert Castles. The complex is very large and was originally planned as two 
enclosures, each 70m square, linked by a corridor - but only the northern half 
was completed. You can make out towers around the external wall, and around 
the entrance are corridors, courtyards, passageways and rooms. The arched 
doorways are particularly striking, even if all the beautifully carved stone lintels 
have been smashed or taken away.
Azraq
AZRAQ - Jordan's only oasis, located 100km east of Amman - has always 
been a crossroads for international traffic. In the past, its location at the head 
of the Wadi Sirhan, the main caravan route from Arabia to Syria (known as 
the Wadi al-Azraq before its settlement by the bedouin Sirhan tribe), meant 
that Azraq was both a vital trading post and a defensive strongpoint. Today, 
traffic passes through Azraq from five directions: highways from Syria to the 
north, Iraq to the east, Saudi Arabia to the south, Amman and Zarqa to the 
west, and the Red Sea port of Aqaba to the southwest ensure that heavy 
lorries thunder through the little town 24 hours a day on their way 
somewhere else. On the approach roads, it's not uncommon to see road-
trains of twenty or thirty trucks nose-to-tail, trundling slowly through the 
desert together.
The reason why this little place attracts such attention is that it is - or was - 
the only permanent oasis in thirty thousand square kilometres of desert. Fed 
by aquifers draining millions of cubic metres of filtered rainwater into a massive 
shallow basin, Azraq (which means "blue" in Arabic) was surrounded by fresh-
water pools and forests of palm and eucalyptus. Literally millions of migrating 
birds stopped off every year to recuperate in the highly improbable lushness on 
their long desert flights between Central Asia and Africa. Water buffalo and wild 
horses were common. The Romans built a fort here - Qasr Azraq - which 
Winston's hiccup
Azraq is situated near the crook of the strange angle formed by Jordan's eastern 
border with Saudi Arabia, which zigzags here for no apparent reason. Demarcation 
of this border was the work of Winston Churchill, then British Colonial Secretary, who 
boasted of having created the new Emirate of Transjordan with a stroke of his pen 
one Sunday afternoon in 1921. A story grew up that, after a particularly liquid lunch 
that day, he had hiccuped while attempting to draw the border and - Winston being 
Winston - had refused to allow it to be redrawn. Thus the zigzag has been written 
into history as "Winston's hiccup".
On closer examination, the truth is rather less engaging: Churchill in fact carefully 
plotted the zigzag to ensure that the massive Wadi Sirhan - holding a vital communi-
cations highway between Damascus and the Arabian interior - ended up excluded 
from the territory of the new emirate. Jordan's resulting "panhandle", a ﬁnger of 
desert territory extending east from Azraq to the Iraqi border, also had signiﬁcance: 
with the French installed dangerously nearby in Syria, it meant that Britain was able 
to maintain a direct, and friendly, air corridor between the Mediterranean and India at 
a time when aircraft were taking an increasingly important role in military and civilian 
communication. The fact that the new, ruler-straight borders cut arbitrarily across 
tribal lands in the desert appeared not to trouble the colonial planners.

was continuously renovated over the succeeding centuries and chosen, in 1917, 
as his headquarters by Lawrence of Arabia.
However, the oasis is on its last legs. After continuous pumping from the 
aquifers to supply ever-growing Amman with drinking water, the springs have 
long since dried up. Ragged palms survive but most migrating birds head for 
Galilee instead. Recent work by the Royal Society for the Conservation of 
Nature (RSCN) to conserve and rejuvenate Azraq's wetlands has seen a good

deal of success, but faces an uphill struggle. The underground reservoirs, 
exploited almost to exhaustion, are turning brackish.
It takes imagination - and an ability to block out traffic noise - to enjoy a stay 
in Azraq, but this is nonetheless a unique place with simple charms. It also has 
virtually the only tourist accommodation in the entire region, as well as the 
best restaurant in eastern Jordan.
Some history
Large numbers of Paleolithic hand axes and flint tools have been discovered 
around Azraq oasis, indicating a substantial settlement up to 200,000 years ago: it 
seems that malachite was being brought from as far away as Ain Ghazal near 
Amman to be worked at Azraq into delicate and beautiful earrings. The Romans 
built a fort on the site of Qasr Azraq in the third century. Qasr Azraq was also used 
by the Byzantines and the Umayyads, and was rebuilt in 1237 by the Ayyubid 
governor Azz ad-Din Aybak, shortly after the Ayyubid leader Salah ad-Din had 
expelled the main Crusader force from east of the Jordan. Still in use under the 
Mamlukes and the Ottomans, the qasr was occupied during the winter of 
1917-18 by Lawrence and the armies of the Arab Revolt; their final attack on 
Damascus, which saw the collapse of Ottoman power, was launched from here.
Just after World War I, wandering Druze, from Jebel Druze nearby in southern 
Syria, occupied the castle for a while, also founding the village outside the walls 
in the area of two large springs of sweet water. The volcanic plains spreading 
south from Jebel Druze engulf the castle, and their village was - and still is - 
dominated by hard black-grey basalt, which is very difficult to cut and dress, 
giving a lumpy, unfinished look to the older parts of the village. Although some 
Druze became farmers, most earned their livelihood from salt production.
Barely a decade later, Chechens arrived at Azraq following a great emigration 
in 1898 from Russian persecution in their homeland in the Caucasus. They 
settled some 7km south of the Druze village, on flat ground near three springs 
feeding a large area of wetland marsh. The basalt runs out in a remarkably clear 
line of scarps about 4km south of the Druze village and the new settlement 
instead lay in an area of limestone. Most of the Chechen émigrés became 
farmers and fisherfolk. To differentiate between the two villages, the first 
became known as Azraq Druze, the second as Azraq Shishan.
Nowadays, with more a mixed population, Azraq Druze is officially Azraq
ash-Shomali (North Azraq) and Azraq Shishan is Azraq al-Janubi (South 
Azraq) - though the old names survive in the minds of most locals. Today, the 
two Azraqs have a combined population of about twelve thousand, not 
including the large contingents of Jordanian and US air force personnel 
quartered at the airbase just outside town.
Arrival and accommodation
The desert roads from Zarqa and Amman meet 9km west of Azraq. All traffic 
is then funnelled towards a T-junction with traffic lights, from where the 
restaurants of Azraq al-Janubi are visible to the right, extending for about 1km 
southwards. To the left, some 7km along the road, lie Qasr Azraq and the village 
of Azraq ash-Shomali (and, 54km further on, Safawi). Buses from Zarqa 
wander through Janubi first, then turn round and head for Shomali, dropping 
off here and there. If you tell the driver where you want to be dropped before-
hand, he'll take you to the door.
Although there are some local minibuses between the two halves of Azraq, 
most people just flag down any vehicle; a simple "Shomali?" or "Janubi?" to the 
driver suffices. A decent offer is at least JD0.50.

The best place to stay is the RSCN's lovely A Azraq Lodge (T05 383 5017 
or 5225, Etourism@rscn.org.jo, Wwww.rscn.org.jo; 6), located off the main 
highway about 600m west of the T-junction, signposted south up a side-road. 
This old British army field hospital, built in the 1940s on a small rise overlooking 
the oasis, served for a time as a hunting lodge. After extensive renovation by the 
Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature - which included restoration of 
period features as well as some new construction - it is now an excellent hotel. 
The atmosphere is friendly and informal; rooms (which are all en suite, with a/c 
and heating) are simple but well designed; and service is faultless. Staff - all of 
whom are Azraq locals - can advise on activities and excursions, and arrange 
meals with advance notice. It's expensive (for more on which, see box, p.171), 
but your money helps fund the RSCN's efforts to conserve Azraq's fragile 
environment and support the local community. Within the Lodge buildings is an 
 Lounge area, Azraq Lodge
THE EASTERN DESERT | Azraq
Moving on from Azraq
Zarqa-bound buses (ﬁrst around 6am, last around 5pm; JD1.50) start from Azraq 
ash-Shomali, cruise up and down collecting passengers, then head to Azraq al-
Janubi and do the same. Stop them at any point and jump on.
No public transport serves Qusayr Amra (25km west of Azraq) or Qasr Harraneh 
(15km further). Hiring a taxi in Azraq to see these two and bring you back will cost 
around JD40-45 - not much less than hiring a nine-seat minibus with driver at the 
RSCN Azraq Lodge (JD50 for full day). Otherwise, you could hitch the whole way, or 
take any bus 9km west to where the Amman highway branches off and hitch from 
there - but fair payment to any drivers who pick you up would total not much less 
than the taxi fare anyhow.
At a junction 23km south of Azraq, a highway branches southeast to the Saudi
border at Umari while the main road - used chieﬂy by trucks plying between Iraq and 
Aqaba port - stays inside Jordan, heading south into the desert to Jafr (after 185km) 
and Ma'an (58km further). It is long on silent desert landscapes, short on anything 
else. Make sure you ﬁll your tank, check your oil and tyres and buy plenty of drinking 
water before you get going.

area of handicraft workshops (open to visitors by arrangement), where local 
women are employed in silk-screening, painting ostrich eggs and sewing textiles 
for sale at RSCN Nature Shops around Jordan.
Otherwise, behind the Refa'i restaurant at the southern end of Azraq al-Janubi 
is Al-Zoubi (T05 383 5012; 2), with budget en-suite rooms - all sleeping three 
or four - that are mostly clean. The soulless Azraq Resthouse aka Tourist Resort
(T05 383 4006; 4) has shabby chalet-style rooms around a swimming pool; 
you'd be justified in wondering how a government-owned establishment gets 
away with illegally sinking a well to fill the pool and water the lawns. To reach 
it, head 2km north of the T-junction and turn west down a 1.5km-long avenue. 
Bargain hard at either.
Qasr Azraq
We hurried up the stony ridge in high excitement, talking of the wars and songs 
and passions of the early shepherd kings, with names like music, who had loved 
this place; and of the Roman legionaries who languished here as garrison in yet 
earlier times. Then the blue fort on its rock above the rustling palms, with the fresh 
meadows and shining springs of water, broke on our sight.
T.E. Lawrence, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom
Lawrence is turning in his grave at the fate of his "blue fort", Qasr Azraq (daily 
8am-6pm; winter closes 4pm; joint ticket with Harraneh and Amra JD1). 
Leaving aside the 1927 earthquake, which shook some height from the walls 
and towers, apartment buildings now loom over the castle, the meadows have 
vanished and the "shining springs of water" have been diverted to keep Amman 
alive. Adding insult to injury, the main highway from Iraq thunders past the 
walls, slicing the castle away from the oasis that inspired it. Nonetheless, it 
remains a romantic and explorable place, with marvellous sunsets, and all the 
more poignant for its modest fame. A Druze family - currently in the third 
generation - have acted as guardians of the castle since the days of Lawrence.
As you enter the dogleg gatehouse, machicolation and an Arabic inscription
commemorating the 1237 renovation of the castle are above your head. The 
massive basalt slab front door still swings on its hinges. Down at your feet, a 
double row of seven indentations in a threshold stone is for a gatekeeper's 
solitaire-type game using pebbles.
Within the courtyard, the rooms immediately to the left were patched up with 
palm fronds either by Lawrence's men or by later Druze occupiers. Further 
around, the west wall is dominated by a massive tower, at the base of which is 
Azraq salt
Strangely for a freshwater oasis, Azraq has separate, extensive underground pockets 
of extremely salty water, which for many years allowed the village to supply much of 
the table salt used in Jordan and Iraq. However the growth of the Dead Sea salt 
works at Saﬁ (which is a far bigger and more efﬁcient operation) now means that 
there is no longer any proﬁt in producing salt in Azraq. The failure of the salt business, 
which was once a major source of income and employment, has serious ecological
implications. Azraq's brine is seeping into the freshwater aquifers beneath the desert 
and turning them brackish. Even worse, Saﬁ's vast evaporation ponds are a major 
contributor to the shrinkage of the Dead Sea. It makes ecological - if not economic - 
sense to share Jordan's salt production between Saﬁ and Azraq, to limit environ-
mental damage at both sites and distribute potential proﬁts evenly. Yet there is no 
sign of that happening.

a three-tonne basalt slab door, barely swingable to and fro: Lawrence described 
the whole west wall trembling as it was slammed shut. The supposed prison in 
the northwest corner features a locking hole in the door-frame rubbed smooth 
and shiny by centuries of curious fingers. To the north are the smoke-blackened 
kitchens and the elegant dining hall, and, beside them, the stables, supported 
by oddly shaped arches: a room here serves as a museum, displaying carved 
stone images of animals found nearby (which are probably Umayyad), and 
Roman milestones and inscribed blocks. A seven-metre well in the east wall

was filled with water until the mid-1980s, but is now dry; the water table has 
dropped. Sitting skewed in the middle of the courtyard is a remarkably graceful 
little three-aisle mosque, probably built during the Ayyubid renovations. The 
highlight, though, is the room above the gate you entered by: this was 
Lawrence's room, accessed by stairs and in a plum position to look out over 
the courtyard and the palms. In Seven Pillars he wrote:
In the evening when we had shut-to the gate, all guests would assemble... and 
coffee and stories would go round until the last meal, and after it, till sleep came. 
On stormy nights, we brought in brushwood and dung and lit a great ﬁre in the 
middle of the ﬂoor. About it would be drawn the carpets and the saddle-sheep-
skins, and in its light we would tell over our own battles, or hear the visitors' 
traditions. The leaping ﬂames chased our smoke-rufﬂed shadows strangely about 
the rough stone wall behind us, distorting them over the hollows and projections 
of its broken face.
Azraq Wetlands Reserve
Spreading east of Azraq al-Janubi village is the Azraq Wetlands Reserve
(Wwww.rscn.org.jo), a sadly depleted shadow of its former self. Before the oasis 
dried up, this whole area of marshes and lakes, in the midst of Azraq's qa, or 
depression, was the scene of vibrant life. Well over a hundred water buffalo 
roamed the area, along with wild horses and small livestock. In the winter of 
1967, a staggering 240,000 ducks landed here, along with 180,000 teals, 100,000 
pintails, 40,000 coots, 20,000 wigeons and 2000 mallards. Insects, molluscs and 
hundreds of thousands of frogs thrived; there's even a particular species of fish, 
the killifish, that is endemic to Azraq's pools. By 1992, though, after disastrous 
human intervention, there was very little left apart from some more or less 
deserted reed-beds and low muddy pools.
In 1998 the RSCN stepped in, and since then has launched a programme to 
protect the wetland area and focus efforts on conservation. A signpost opposite 
the petrol station in Azraq al-Janubi points the way down a side-street to the 
wetland reserve's Visitor Centre (daily 8am-6pm; winter closes 4pm). Inside, 
as well as a small shop, is an interpretation room, leading you past informa-
tion boards (in English) outlining the conservation issues at play in Azraq - as 
well as a tank of tiny striped killifish.
Admission to the reserve costs JD7. From the Visitor Centre, the circular 
Marsh Trail (1.5km) heads off into the reed-beds. Brisk walkers could cover 
the circuit in ten minutes; dawdlers could find enough out there to keep them 
interested for hours, including ruins that are thought to be Umayyad or Roman. 
The water which you can see gushing into the pools between the reeds has 
come from Amman: it's the minuscule amount that the government is pumping 
back into the wetlands as a gesture towards eco-friendliness. Overlooking a 
waterhole near the end of the trail is a hide built of mud-brick, from where 
you can watch the birdlife - and, if you're lucky, the water buffalo which roam 
the reed-beds. Serious birders can arrange in advance with RSCN staff at the 
Azraq Lodge (see p.205) to be taken out to the hide at dawn.
Eating and drinking
Azraq's best food is served at the RSCN A Azraq Lodge (see p.205), where the 
restaurant is run by a local Chechen family: the meals they serve are outstanding 
- carefully presented home-cooked fare, including Arabic dishes of kebabs and 
chicken and rice, salads and fresh fruit alongside delicately flavoured Chechen 
THE EASTERN DESERT | Azraq

209
specialities, including cheese soup, mantaish (a hearty dish of mutton and onions), 
gelnesh (rather like chicken and veal wontons), and more. Expect to pay JD13-15 
a head. It is essential to book - for lunch or dinner - at least two days ahead.
Almost every tour bus that stops in Azraq disgorges its passengers at the Azraq 
Palace Tourist Restaurant (daily 11am-10pm), set in its own walled grounds north 
of the T-junction near the signpost to the Resthouse. This is truly grim, with 
bog-standard rice, stews and salads dished up buffet-style to a captive clientele 
(JD7-10 depending on choices): the decor, fake bedouin tent and caged animals 
are likely to appeal to only the most jaded of tour groups. Instead, aim for Azraq 
al-Janubi, where the main drag is lined with restaurants. Some serve truckers' 
fare (meat stew or roast chicken), while others - the ones with fancier decor - 
dish up Lebanese-style salads and kebabs to passing Saudi families. As good as 
any is Al-Kahf, or The Cave (no English sign), a sunken den made of basalt 
stones, with a row of neon spiders and a giant dalleh coffeepot outside.
Death of an oasis
Before 1975, Azraq positively gushed with water, fed to the village from all points of 
the compass. Rain falling on Jebel Druze 80km to the north takes just a few years to 
ﬁlter through the basalt to Azraq's aquifers. Five springs (two in Shomali and three in 
Janubi) poured 34 million litres of water every day into Azraq's pools. In addition, a 
total of ten river beds feed into Azraq's qa, including the mighty Wadi Sirhan from the 
southeast and Wadi Rajil from the north, draining surface rainwater (separate from 
the underground aquifers) towards Azraq. In rainy years, the entire qa - ﬁfty square 
kilometres in the midst of a parched and burning desert - was ﬂooded to a depth of 
a metre or more with sweet water.
The abundance was too tempting to resist. In 1963, a small amount of pumping
began from Azraq to Irbid; the oasis could replenish itself and no damage was done. 
But, following the 1967 war with Israel, the population of Amman in particular was 
swollen by hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees. Jordan's water infrastruc-
ture couldn't cope. In 1975, large-scale pumping to Amman began, Azraq alone 
supplying a quarter of the city's water. In addition, Syria dammed the Wadi Rajil, 
depriving the qa of a third of its run-off water. Jordan then tapped Azraq's aquifers 
deeper, this time fatally - yet still, in 1977, signed an international treaty protecting 
wetland habitats.
During the 1980s, Azraq gained a reputation as an attractive and fruitful place to 
farm: city folk began to move in and sink illegal private wells to irrigate their ﬁelds. 
Whereas in previous years such wells needed to be only 3m deep, by this time drilling 
ten times deeper produced no water. In 1992, after just seventeen years of abuse, 
the fragile wetlands dried up.
Almost two decades on, 25 million cubic metres (mcm) of Azraq water is still being 
pumped annually to Amman - a city which, it's been claimed, loses 55 percent of its 
water through leaky pipes - while as much as a further 50mcm is drawn off by an 
estimated 700 illegal local wells. Rainfall can only contribute under half of this 
amount, and at this rate the underground reservoirs have barely twenty more years' 
supply. Yet this shortfall is only one of Azraq's ticking time bombs. Normally, a natural 
balance in water pressure exists between the freshwater aquifers and neighbouring 
pockets of brine. However, pressure has now been dangerously lowered in the 
aquifers. Seepage of salt is already occurring, and is irreversible: once brackish, an 
aquifer stays brackish forever.
Almost the only lifeline is the scheme to pipe drinking water to Amman from Diseh
(near Wadi Rum) and the proposed Red-Dead Canal (see p.131). The surplus they 
generate may mean that less water is pumped from Azraq. Time will tell whether the 
oasis can claw its way back from the brink.

Shaumari Wildlife Reserve
Out in the baking desert south of Azraq, where the highest point of land for 
miles around is the road, raised a metre or two above the dust, nestles the 
Shaumari Wildlife Reserve (Wwww.rscn.org.jo), 22 square kilometres of 
desert that is Jordan's leading centre for captive breeding of endangered Arabian 
oryx. Drive 7km south of Azraq al-Janubi and you'll see a sign for the reserve 
pointing right: the entrance lies 6km along this sometimes rough turn-off, 
marked by a grove of eucalyptus trees that is visible for miles around. No public 
transport runs close; if you don't have a car, the going rate for a hitch - from 
just about anyone in Azraq al-Janubi - is JD15 one-way.
However, at the time of writing the reserve was closed for major renovation 
work. Check online, or with staff at the Azraq Lodge, for the latest news about 
access. Even while the reserve is closed, it's still possible to join a safari 
(JD8pp; minimum ten people) to get close to the oryx and explore their 
desert habitat, which is also home to snakes, sand rats, lizards, the occasional 
caracal, jackal or wildcat, plus plenty of birdlife. Staff can also arrange a night 
safari (same price), a thrilling chance to get out into the desert after dark to 
view the nocturnal wildlife - and the astonishingly clear night skies. Either 
must be booked well in advance.
The Eastern Badia
Jordan tends to be defined as a desert land, yet most people - locals as well as 
visitors - don't ever get to know the desert, spending virtually all their time in 
the fertile, relatively well-watered strip of hilly territory running down the 
western part of the country. Although the sandy areas around Wadi Rum in the 
so-called Southern Badia are now well known, much less is understood about 
the vast stony deserts which occupy more than eighty percent of Jordanian 
territory, the Eastern Badia - covering, roughly, everything east of Amman 
and Mafraq, and south almost to Jafr. The Badia (pronounced "bad-ya"; from the 
same root as "bedouin") lacks the drama of Rum's soaring cliffs and red sand 
dunes, yet holds some of the most striking natural scenery in the country, from 
the boulder-strewn, volcanic Black Desert, or harra, close to the Syrian border, 
out to the hamad, or undulating limestone plateau and grasslands in the farthest 
corners of the country near Iraq.
Desert travel is sometimes seen as a process of combating the tedium while 
getting from A to B, but you'll have much more satisfaction if you abandon your 
itinerary and treat the desert as a destination in its own right. With suitable 
preparation, adventurous explorers out here will be rewarded with an extraor-
dinary diversity of environments and some stunning natural drama.
This wedge of desert is praised by naturalists as being one of the most 
rewarding areas for birdwatching in the whole of Jordan. Recent notable 
animal sightings have included the sand cat, the Levantine viper and Tilbury's 
Spring-Footed Lizard, all of them rarities, and ongoing investigations have 
turned up 49 plant species new to science. In addition, there's a handful of 
relatively minor archeological sites that serve as a useful hook on which to hang 
a visit. Everything centres on the small, dusty town of Safawi: north lie the 
ruins of Jawa, a long-abandoned city; south is the holy tree of Biqya'wiyya
which, legend has it, once sheltered the Prophet Muhammad; and east, barely 
50km from the Iraqi border, is the astonishing, mirage-like apparition of the 
glittering lake and ruined black castle of Burqu.

Practicalities
Transport in this most remote area of Jordan is difficult, and requires consider-
able forward planning. Relying on public transport won't get you far; there 
are buses from Mafraq to Safawi, with fewer heading on to Ruwayshid and 
beyond, but none goes anywhere near sites of interest. Even if you reach, say, 
Ruwayshid, your chances of being able to get out to Burqu independently - or 
get back from it - are virtually nil.
The way to go is in a 4x4, well equipped with spares, communications equipment, 
food and plenty of drinking water, plus a local guide who knows the area. A 
handful of local and foreign tour operators organize tours - some focused on 
birdwatching, others on archeology - that can get you out to sites such as Jawa 
or Burqu. Your first point of contact should be the RSCN, either their "Wild 
Jordan" tourism unit in Amman (see p.51) or at the Azraq Lodge in Azraq. They 
have the expertise and local knowledge to put a special itinerary together for you, 
Developing the Badia
Jordan's arid areas, known as the Badia, cover approximately 85 percent of the 
country, yet are home to only ﬁve percent of the population. Although its annual rainfall 
is less than 200mm, the Badia provides Jordan with over half its groundwater needs 
and almost a quarter of national GDP: today, these arid regions are seen as the 
country's agricultural and industrial resource base. With Jordan's ongoing population 
explosion, urban areas are unable to cope, and in recent years growing numbers of 
people have abandoned the cities and moved out to make a life in the Badia.
Traditionally, the Badia was home to the nomadic bedouin, but the growing power 
of urban communities in the twentieth century increasingly affected bedouin social 
life as well as the physical environment. Key resources were exploited mainly for the 
urban population's beneﬁt, and services and products generated by the urban 
community became integrated into the lifestyle of the bedouin, reducing their sense 
of responsibility for the environment. Vegetation was destroyed, erosion increased, 
groundwater was tapped, and scarce resources were squandered. The bedouin 
became alienated from the central authorities.
Sheep have been a constant problem - a traditional small-scale livelihood for the 
bedouin that now severely threatens land resources through overgrazing by hugely 
expanded ﬂocks. In one sector of the Eastern Badia, roughly 18,000 people live in an 
area of 11,000 square kilometres, yet they may, at certain times of year, share the 
land with 1.5 million sheep. And yet, perversely, the local sheep industry is almost 
nonexistent: Jordan imports most of its mutton from Australia, and wool is a non-
starter, with most farmers shearing with hand-clippers for domestic use only. Another 
signiﬁcant problem is education: a third of the Badia's children aren't enrolled in 
school at all. Graduates - especially women - have great difﬁculty ﬁnding jobs in the 
Badia, so the best local teachers tend to move to Amman. Badia schools give 
students little grounding in either the arts or vocational sciences such as agriculture 
or engineering; almost half the Badia's population over the age of 19 is illiterate, and 
just three percent are university graduates.
However, notions of the Badia and bedouin life are key to the Jordanian national 
character. Jordan's Higher Council for Science and Technology, with the backing of 
Britain's Royal Geographical Society and Durham University, has established the 
Badia Research and Development Centre (BRDC; Wwww.badia.gov.jo), to investi-
gate the Badia's human and natural resources and the possibilities for sustainable 
development. They have identiﬁed vast potential in the Badia, ranging from mineral 
resources to ecotourism, traditional crafts and renewable energy, and are having 
some success in turning around the priorities of local farmers. Projects to introduce 
sustainable development in the Badia are gaining traction.

and Azraq is the best base from which to explore the area. Also seek advice from 
the Badia Research and Development Centre (T02 629 0111, Wwww.badia.gov
.jo), who might be able arrange an overnight stay in Safawi with sufficient notice.
Safawi
The major town of the Eastern Badia is SAFAWI, 75km east of Mafraq and 
53km north of Azraq. It's an oil-stained, engine-roaring kind of place that's 
unlikely to inspire: there are no hotels and just a handful of restaurants. You may 
spot roadsigns to Safawi that include "H5" in brackets; this refers to a pumping 
station along the route of an oil pipeline constructed in the 1930s, which 
prompted the later construction of the highway alongside. Only operational for 
fifteen years up until the declaration of the State of Israel in 1948, the pipeline 
originated in Kirkuk, Iraq, with one branch running through Syria to Tripoli 
on the Lebanese coast, and the other through Jordan to Haifa, now in Israel. All 
the pumping stations along the Haifa branch were numbered with the prefix 
"H": H4 is just before Ruwayshid, while Safawi developed around the H5 
pumping station, whose buildings are now part-occupied by the Jordan Badia 
Research and Development Centre (see box).
North of Safawi
Sandwiched between Safawi and the Syrian border are the hilly expanses of the 
Hawran, a black desert of igneous rocks spewed out in antiquity by the now-
extinct volcano of Jebel Druze, just over the border. Within this strip, east of 
Umm al-Jimal (see p.192), are a string of rural communities and a handful of 
ancient sites accessible by car, the most impressive - Jawa - only by 4x4.
About 20km west of Safawi you'll spot to the side of the road the twin hills of 
Aritayn ("Two Lungs"); shortly after, the road swings northwest towards Mafraq 
around the aptly named Jebel al-Asfar ("Yellow Mountain"), towards the 
jutting scarp of Tell ar-Remah. At Bishriyyeh, a side-road branches northeast for 
15km to DAYR AL-KAHF village, less than 5km from the Syrian border, 
which hosts a substantial, well-preserved Roman fort, dating from 306 AD. 
 A long desert drive
THE EASTERN DESERT | The Eastern Badia

213
(Coming from Umm al-Jimal, drive 7km past the site's information hut, turn left 
at the T-junction and then right after 22km; Dayr al-Kahf's fort comes into view 
26km further.) The fort was one of many situated on the Strata Diocletiana, a 
frontier road designed by Emperor Diocletian to link Bosra with Azraq. The 
basalt walls of the overgrown fort are still standing, and some have been restored. 
A wander around the quiet courtyard reveals ground-floor stables and remnants 
of carved columns dumped in the plastered cistern. In the east wall one perfect 
arch survives; nearby rooms sport internal arches and intact corbelling. Opposite, 
in the west wall, is a rebuilt arched section; going through, and then looking back, 
reveals reused Roman columns either side of the elegant doorway. On the north 
side of the fort is a small tower overlooking a reused Roman reservoir.
The road east from Dayr al-Kahf heads on to the hamlet of DAYR 
AL-QINN, with its own crumbling Roman fort, more ruinous than its 
neighbour, with only a few original walls standing. Along its west wall is a line 
of small, internally partitioned rooms, with a hinge and a door lock still present 
in one surviving door-frame. At the rear of the site (north), climb up onto the 
highest point of the ruins to look over the large reservoir onto the rolling 
hills; the nearby white shack is the Jordanian army's frontier post, and beyond 
it is a square white building marking the Syrian army position. From the same 
spot, you can look west over one of the fort's surviving lintels to spot on the 
horizon the Roman tower at Ghrarba in Syria.
Jawa
About 25km east of Dayr al-Kahf - and only accessible with a 4x4 with a local 
guide - lie the bleak and mysterious ruins of JAWA, a town constructed five 
thousand years ago from the local basalt by an unknown people, occupied for 
only fifty years then abandoned. The rubbly, hard-to-decipher site stands 
desolate on a rocky hill; non-archeologists will probably find themselves in awe 
more of the spectacular surroundings of the Black Desert than of the ruins 
themselves. In these vast expanses of basalt, the silence and sense of ominous 
open space are overwhelming.
Some 2km out of Dayr al-Qinn, follow a rough track heading right off the 
road along the right-hand bank of the large Wadi Rajil for 5km into the desert. 
The substantial walls of Jawa will soon come into view ahead, fortifying an 
impressive craggy outcrop above the deep wadi, which describes a dramatic 
curve around the ancient city. You can park alongside a modern reservoir at the 
foot of Jawa's hill, and scramble up. Without specialist interpretation, it can be 
hard to make sense of the tumbled ruins, although the division into lower and 
upper districts is clear; over a thousand years after its construction, a citadel of 
sorts was built in the upper town during the Middle Bronze Age, presumably 
to serve as a caravanserai on the routes between Syria and Mesopotamia to the 
north and Palestine, Egypt and Arabia to the south. Scrambling around the hill, 
in and out of the closely packed houses - tiny, irregularly shaped one-room 
shacks - is just as impressive as stopping and listening to the silence of the 
surroundings, broken only by the occasional bird-call and the sound of the 
wind sweeping up the defile of the Wadi Rajil.
South of Safawi
On the western edge of Safawi town is the junction of the roads to Mafraq 
and Azraq. Almost exactly 15km along the Azraq road - but without any signs 
or noticeable landmarks - a side-track branches off the highway on a lovely 
journey towards the holy tree of Biqya'wiyya, well worth the tough, 
35-minute ride by 4x4 across open country.
THE EASTERN DESERT | The Eastern Badia

214
In his youth, the Prophet Muhammad is said to have travelled at the behest of 
a wealthy widow Khadija (who later became his wife) from his hometown of 
Mecca north across the desert to Syria. Accompanying Muhammad on this 
trading mission was Khadija's slave, Maysarah. During the journey the caravan 
stopped for a break near the remote home of a Christian monk named Bahira. 
While Muhammad rested under a wild pistachio tree, Bahira came up to 
Maysarah and asked, "Who is that man?" - to which Maysarah replied, "That is 
one of the tribe of Quraysh, who guard the Kaaba in Mecca." In a reply which 
has passed into folklore, Bahira then said, "No one but a Prophet is sitting 
beneath that tree." Islamic tradition holds that the particular tree beneath which 
Muhammad rested still lives; although there are competing claims, the prime 
candidate stands far out in the desert south of Safawi. The fact that dendro-
chronologists have estimated the tree's age at only around 500 years detracts 
from the power of the legend not one jot.
As soon as you leave the Safawi-Azraq highway, the track deteriorates to 
reveal an old, five-metre-wide cambered pilgrims' roadway, possibly Ottoman, 
although known to locals as the "British Road", made of fieldstones packed 
together, with defined kerbstones and a central spine. This leads dead straight 
out across the undulating desert, visible for miles ahead without diversion. 
Watch for kilometre markers all along the side of this route: the first, just off the 
highway, is 978; after 3km of a very bumpy ride you pass a modern brick hut 
marked "Km 975". Around 1500m further across the stony desert is a gentle 
rise, on the far side of which - in a memorable flourish of natural drama - 
stretches a vast area of fertile rolling grassland, often dotted with standing 
water, soft on the eye and echoing with the calls of swooping birds. A little after 
Km 970 is another small rise, which gives onto more gentle countryside in the 
area known as Biqya'wiyya, and shortly after you'll be able to see the holy
tree itself, which lies about 300m past Km 967 in a beautiful setting on the 
edge of a flowing stream feeding a modern reservoir. It's the only tree within 
view - indeed, just about the only tree visible on the entire journey from Safawi 
- in a peaceful and pleasant spot, from where stretch out vast panoramas across 
the open desert. Bear in mind, however, that this is a holy place, and that the 
local bedouin as well as pilgrims from around Jordan and elsewhere make the 
long journey here specifically in order to pray and spend time alone or with 
their families in the presence of the Prophet. Frivolity, or stripping off to go 
bathing in the temptingly cool water, would be most disrespectful, as would 
tampering in any way either with the tree itself or with the strips of cloth which 
pilgrims leave tied to the lower branches as a mark of respect.
Asaykhim
Some 39km south of Safawi - just past the experimental Tell Hassan renewable 
energy station (complete with wind pump and solar panels) - or 15km north 
of Azraq ash-Shomali, are the hilltop ruins of the Roman fort at Asaykhim, 
definitely worth the effort to reach for the extraordinary views and ravishing 
sunsets. As usual in this region, you can only get here with a 4x4 and a guide: 
it's a tough half-hour drive east from the Safawi-Azraq road across stones and 
up steep gradients, although the hilltop ruins are clearly visible from some 
distance away. Asaykhim was one of a string of fortified stations built along the 
road between Azraq and Bosra, probably in the third century AD, to protect the 
empire's exposed eastern frontier. It occupies a commanding position. A 
scramble to the summit will reveal a series of small rooms built around a 
courtyard, the walls twelve courses high in places, with a gatehouse and some 
arched ceiling supports still standing. The arch in one room on the west wall has

lost the ceiling it once supported, and stands alone facing the setting sun. It's the 
breathtaking 360° panorama that makes Asaykhim memorable, far more than 
the ruins: locals say that you can see all the Badia from up here.
Another reason for embarking on a 4x4 trek out here is to be able to wander 
on foot in the natural Safaitic art gallery of the rugged basalt desert to the east 
of the hill. A surprising number of the boulders and rocks here feature some 
kind of prehistoric inscription or drawing, most of which are probably at least 
ten thousand years old: in this once-lush land, anonymous shepherds and 
farmers drew stylized people, camels and other animals, geometric patterns and 
random unknown markings on the only canvas they had available - basalt. The 
article "Safaitic art" by Jordanian artist Ammar Khammash, found under 
"Geology Tourism" at Wwww.pellamuseum.org explains more.
East of Safawi
A short way east of Safawi, the highway crosses the Wadi Rajil, which feeds 
water falling on Jebel Druze in Syria south to Azraq. Soon after, you pass 
alongside the prominent Jibal Ashqaf mountains, looming on both sides above 
the rolling slopes of black rocks (overlaying yellowish sand) which fill the 
immensely long sightlines in all directions. The Ashqaf area marks a watershed, 
since the large Wadi Ghsayn which runs alongside the road further east drains 
water into the flat Qa Abul Ghsayn and then to Burqu and north into Syria. As 
you head on east, you cross the dividing line between the black stony harra
desert and flatter limestone hamad, which stretches east to the Iraqi border and 
is much more soothing on the eye. Some 90km east of Safawi is a lazy check-
point at Muqat, starting point for a journey north along the Wadi Muqat into 
the roadless desert towards Burqu (see below).
About 10km east of Muqat is the last town in Jordan, RUWAYSHID, another 
shabby but bustling place boasting a couple of truckers' motels and a few diners. 
A dual-lane highway makes short work of the 79km to the border, which is 
better known by the name of the Iraqi border post Turaybil than by the 
Jordanian post of Karama. Baghdad is about 550km further east.
Burqu
The qasr at BURQU (pronounced "beurkaa" with a throaty gargle: "berkoo" 
is wrong) can be grouped - archeologically speaking - with the "Desert 
Castles" of Hallabat, Azraq and others, a small Roman fort occupied and 
expanded during the Islamic period. However, the ruins take a poor second 
place to Burqu's extraordinary natural environment, both on the off-road 
journey to reach the site and once you arrive. The qasr stands on the shores of 
Ghadir Burqu, a substantial lake some 2km long which is fabulous enough 
by itself, hidden in the depths of the desert, but which also serves as the lifeline 
and congregation point for an array of animals and local and migrating birds. 
Proposed to become a protected nature reserve, Burqu is a wild and dramatic 
place, well worth the long and difficult journey. It lies at the focal point of 
desert tracks roughly 18km north of Muqat or 25km northwest of Ruwayshid, 
and is all but impossible to locate without the help of a guide with intimate 
local knowledge.
The dam 2km north of the qasr (which led to the lake's formation) and the 
jagged, broken-off tower which still rises above the ruined walls of the castle are 
thought to have been constructed in the third century, possibly to guard the 
water source for caravans travelling between Syria and Arabia. Inhabited 
throughout the Byzantine period - possibly as a monastery - Burqu was 
expanded by Emir Walid in the year 700 AD; an inscription dated 1409 might

indicate occupation up to that date. The entrance into the qasr is on the north 
wall, which gives access to two inscriptions - one naming Walid - above the 
lintel of the room in the far left-hand corner of the rubble-strewn courtyard, 
next to a room with a pointed arch. In the opposite corner is a small, 
freestanding circular room with a cross carved into its lintel; next to it is the 
original tower, still standing to around 8m, with a tiny, easily defended door 
(now blocked) in one wall.
However, it's the lake and its flora and fauna which most impress. The journey 
from Muqat to Burqu crosses a large, flat qa, from which subterranean water 
rises to form the lake, full almost year-round and bordered in spring by poppies, 
irises and other wildflowers. Gently lapping wavelets fringe the most incon-
gruous beach you're ever likely to stroll on.
The projected nature reserve is to be centred on this mirage-like apparition, 
which stands between two very different habitats. To the east is a vast expanse 
of hamad, or stony desert pavement, covered with bushes and grasses in winter. 
To the west sweeps the black Harrat ash-Sham, a moonscape of basalt rocks 
ranging in size from a few centimetres to a metre or more across. The rocks 
make the harra impassable even for 4x4 jeeps: hunters cannot penetrate the area, 
turning it into a perfect wildlife refuge. Gazelles roam the harra, in addition to 
hyenas, wolves, red foxes, wildcats, caracals and hares. Birders, too, will be 
delighted: as well as regular sightings of sandpipers, larks, wheatears and finches, 
Burqu boasts herons, pelicans, storks and cranes, along with buzzards, owls, 
vultures and even the rare Verreaux's Eagle. Rumours, as yet unsubstantiated, 
persist among the locals of the presence of cheetahs. For the latest news about 
access, check with staff at the Azraq Lodge.

The King's Highway
T
he KING'S HIGHWAY - the grandiose translation of an old 
Hebrew term which probably only meant "main road" - is a long, 
meandering squiggle of a road running through some of Jordan's 
loveliest countryside. It has been the route of north-south trade and 
the scene of battles since prehistoric times. Moses was refused permission 
to travel on the King's Highway by the king of Edom, and later, the 
Nabateans, from their power base in Petra, used the highway to trade 
luxury goods between Arabia and Syria (Petra merits its own chapter, 
starting on p.259). When the Romans annexed the Nabatean kingdom, 
Emperor Trajan renovated the ancient road to facilitate travel and commu-
nications between his regional capital at Bosra, now in southern Syria, and 
Aqaba on the Red Sea coast. Early Christian pilgrims visited a number of 
sites on and off the road around Madaba, whose beautiful Byzantine 
mosaics still merit a pilgrimage today. The Crusaders used the highway as 
the linchpin of their Kingdom of Oultrejourdain, fortifying positions along 
the road at Karak and Shobak - where extensive remains of castles survive 
- and also at Petra and Aqaba.
However, with the development by the Ottomans of the faster and more 
direct Darb al-Hajj (Pilgrimage Route), from Damascus to Medina and Mecca 
through the desert further east - and the subsequent construction of both the 
Hejaz Railway and the modern Desert Highway along the same route - the 
King's Highway faded in importance. Only tarmacked along its entire length in 
the 1950s and 1960s, today it is a simple road, often rutted and narrow, which 
follows the contours of the rolling hills above the Dead Sea rift. Linking a series 
of springs, and also following the line of maximum hilltop rainfall, the road runs 
through fields and small towns: travelling on it can give you a glimpse of the 
reality of rural life for many Jordanians, and also open up possibilities for explo-
ration of the untouristed countryside. One particular draw is the spectacular 
Dana Nature Reserve, set in a deep and isolated valley, with good facilities 
for camping and hiking.
Transport practicalities
Whether you have a day or a week, the best way to travel on the King's 
Highway is by rental car, since there is no public transport running the length 
of the road. 
All buses from Amman to towns along the highway start out on the faster but 
duller Desert Highway and only cut west on feeder roads at the last moment. 
Thus, Karak-bound buses bypass Madaba, Tafileh buses bypass Karak, Shobak 
buses bypass Tafileh, and buses to Petra or Aqaba bypass them all. Public

transport along the King's Highway is limited to a series of point-to-point local 
bus routes: to make any sort of distance you either have to switch buses several 
times in small villages or resort to hitching.
The best overnight stops are at Madaba, where there's a choice of mid-range 
family-run hotels, and Dana, which has guesthouses and nature camping. Karak, 
the most obvious midway stop on the highway, is a disappointment: it has only 
one decent hotel and the plainest of restaurants.
Note the warning on p.121 concerning the various scams and cut-price deals 
operated by Amman hotels keen to service the market for trips along the King's 
Highway to Petra. The most reliable and best-value of these private bus services 
is operated by the Mariam Hotel in Madaba (see p.224).
Madaba to Wadi Mujib
Much as it did in antiquity, the initial portion of the King's Highway south of 
Amman runs through small farming villages interspersed among wide plains of 
wheat. The edge of the plateau overlooking the Dead Sea rift is never far from 
the road, and countless tracks lead off westwards into the hills teetering over the 
lowest point on earth. The largest town, and only worthwhile place to stay, is 
Madaba, capital of its own governorate. South of Madaba, the King's Highway 
meanders across several valleys draining rainwater off the hills, including the 
dramatic canyon of Wadi Mujib.
Madaba
The easy-going market town of MADABA, 30km southwest of Amman, is best 
known for the dozens of fine Byzantine mosaics preserved in its churches and 
museums. An impressive sixth-century mosaic map of the Holy Land takes top 
billing in package tours, but the town's narrow streets, dotted with fine old 
Ottoman stone houses, lead to plenty more examples that are often ignored by 
visitors in a hurry. Excursions to the mosaics at Mount Nebo - the peak where 
Moses looked over the Promised Land - as well as numerous other natural and 
historical attractions (outlined on p.233), make Madaba an ideal base for two or 
three days of exploration. Add to this easy access to Amman, the Dead Sea and 
the Baptism Site of Jesus (see p.137), as well as a clutch of pleasant mid-range 
hotels - not to mention a location just 18km from Queen Alia International 
Airport - and Madaba becomes a viable, good-value alternative to basing 
yourself in the capital.
Some history
Madaba is first mentioned in the Old Testament as having been conquered - 
along with the rest of the land of Moab - by the Israelites, who then parcelled 
it out to the tribe of Reuben. The city was won back for Moab in the middle 
of the ninth century BC by King Mesha (as proclaimed in the famous Mesha 
Stele; see p.240), at which point the Israelite prophet Isaiah stepped in,

prophesying doom: "Moab shall howl over Nebo and over Medeba: on all 
their heads shall be baldness and every beard cut off... everyone shall howl, 
weeping abundantly." After some further turmoil during the Hellenistic 
period, with the city passing from Greek hands to Jewish to Nabatean, the 
Roman Provincia Arabia brought order; by the third century AD, Madaba 
was minting its own coins.
Christianity spread rapidly and, by 451, Madaba had its own bishop. Mosai-
cists had been at work in and around the town since well before the 390s, but 
mosaic art really began to flourish in Madaba during the reign of the Emperor 
Justinian (527-65). Towards the end of that century, Bishop Sergius oversaw a 
golden age of artistic accomplishment: surviving mosaics from the Cathedral 
(576), the Church of the Apostles (578), the Church of Bishop Sergius at Umm 
ar-Rasas (587), Madaba's Crypt of St Elianos and Church of the Virgin (both 
595) and the Moses Memorial Church on Mount Nebo (597) - as well as, 
conceivably, the famed mosaic map of the Holy Land - all date from his period 
in office. When the Persian armies came through in 614, closely followed by 
the Muslims, Madaba surrendered without a fight and so retained its Christian 
identity and population; churches were still being built and mosaics laid for 
another hundred years or more. A mosaic discovered at Umm ar-Rasas 
mentions a bishop of Madaba as late as 785.
Madaba was abandoned during the Mamluke period and its ruins - by then 
strewn over a huge artificial mound, or tell - lay untouched for centuries. In 
1879, conflict between Christian and Muslim tribes in Karak led to ninety 
Catholic and Orthodox families going into voluntary exile; they arrived at 
Madaba's uninhabited tell shortly after, laid claim to the surrounding land and 
began to farm. The Ottoman authorities in Damascus rubber-stamped the fait 
accompli but gave the settlers permission to build new churches only on the 
sites of previously existing ones. It was in 1884, during clearance work for a new 
church, that Madaba's remarkable mosaic map of the Holy Land was 
uncovered, closely followed by many more mosaics which lay in churches and 
houses all over the town. Scholars and archeologists arrived from all over the 
world, and their investigations still regularly uncover mosaics and remnants of 
the past beneath the streets of the modern town centre.
These days the social and religious balance of the town is changing, in a 
process of urbanization that has seen tens of thousands of Muslim families 
migrating from nearby villages to occupy Madaba's suburbs and outskirts. 
Although Christians still comprise the overwhelming majority of inhabitants 
in the city centre (estimates put the proportion at over 95 percent), Madaba's 
total Christian population today is around 14,000 in a greater municipality that 
has ballooned above 120,000.
Arrival, information and accommodation
Buses from Amman, Dhiban and elsewhere (there are no buses from Karak) 
arrive at the bus station, situated on the King's Highway about ten minutes' 
walk to the east of the town centre. The tourist office (daily 8am-5pm; T05
325 3563) is in the Visitor Centre, reached from Abu Bakr as-Saddeeq Street or 
the car park just below it. Also check out Wwww.visitmadaba.org, the 
excellent website of the Madaba Tourism Association. For details of some fine 
opportunities for adventure excursions near Madaba, including canyoning, 
trekking and mountain-biking, see p.234.
Madaba is one of Jordan's most characterful towns, and has a pack of decent, 
good-value mid-range hotels - many of them family-run and most offering a 
genial, easy-going ambience that's hard to find in Amman.
THE KING'S HIGHWAY | Madaba

224
Moving on from Madaba
From the bus station there are four bus routes running to different points in 
Amman: more or less direct to Tabarbour, Mahatta and Wihdat stations, and a long 
way round to Muhajireen station, via Hesban and Na'ur. The last departs around 
9pm. Buses also run to Zarqa, from where there are connections east to Azraq. In 
addition, buses run from Madaba over the crest of Mount Nebo and down to 
Shuneh al-Janubiyyeh in the Jordan Valley; to reach the Dead Sea, ask the driver 
if he'll go a bit further and drop you off at "Amman Beach", or just take a connecting 
bus to Amman Beach from Shuneh.
An alternative is to book a taxi at discount rates through the Mariam Hotel (see 
listings) and share the cost between three or four passengers: at the time of writing, 
the Mariam can do a return trip from Madaba to Mount Nebo, the Dead Sea and the 
Baptism Site for JD30, including an hour at each site; to Jerash and Ajloun for 
JD40; to the "Desert Castles" for JD45; to the airport for JD12; and direct to Aqaba
for JD68.
For full details of getting to Mount Nebo, Hesban, Hammamat Ma'in, Mukawir and 
Umm ar-Rasas, see the relevant accounts on the next few pages. 
Along the King's Highway to Petra
For points south along the King's Highway, nearly all regular buses terminate in 
Dhiban, the last town before the dramatic gorge of Wadi Mujib. However, Charl al-
Twal, the enterprising owner of Madaba's Mariam Hotel, has started up his own 
King's Highway taxi service between Madaba and Petra, departing from Madaba at 
10am, stopping brieﬂy at Wadi Mujib, then for an hour at Karak, arriving in Wadi Musa 
around 4pm. It runs each day that at least three people have reserved in advance
for the journey (you don't have to be staying at the Mariam) - and only runs from north 
to south. His bargain fare is JD18 per person (or, if you prefer to charter your own 
taxi, JD54 in total).
Black Iris north of town off Yarmouk St T05 324 
1959, Wwww.blackirishotel.com. Clean, spacious 
and characterful family-run hotel, quiet and well 
run, with en-suite twins and doubles. A pleasant, 
welcoming choice. 3
Madaba Inn Yarmouk St T05 325 9003, 
Wwww.madabainn.com. The highest-rated (and 
so most expensive) hotel in town, in an unbeat-
able location right in the centre - but not neces-
sarily top choice: feels more like a business hotel 
than somewhere to relax. Rooms are neat and 
airy, though rather plain. 6
Mariam Aisha Umm al-Mumeneen St 
T05 325 1529, Wwww.mariamhotel.com. 
Best hotel in Madaba (and one of the best in the 
country), family-run and located on a residential 
street ten minutes' walk north of the centre. It is 
rated as two stars, though easily deserves three - 
and, frankly, puts some four-star hotels to shame in 
terms of facilities, service and ambience. The 
rooms - spacious and bright, with en-suite 
bathrooms - are spotless and comfortable, while 
breakfast and other meals on request are served in 
the rooftop restaurant or on the poolside terrace. 
The welcoming and knowledgeable owner, Charl 
al-Twal, is a mine of information on the history of 
Madaba (which features his own family promi-
nently) and on travelling around Jordan. Ask about 
the bargain rates for local and long-distance taxis. 
Often full: book well in advance, especially in high 
season. 3
Moab Land opposite St George's Church main 
gate T05 325 1318. Decent choice, run by a 
friendly, helpful family. Roomy en-suite twins and 
doubles have a nice attention to detail, some with 
balconies overlooking the street, and there's a 
great roof terrace for breakfasts with a view over 
the whole town. The only potential drawback is 
some noise from the busy street in front. 3
Mosaic City off Yarmouk St T05 325 
1313, Wwww.mosaiccityhotel.com. Another 
ﬁne choice in a good location just north of the 
town centre - a new building, with a range of 
high-quality rooms that represent excellent value. 
Also family-run, with a warm welcome and good 
facilities. 4
Salome Aisha Umm al-Mumeneen St T05 324 
8606, Wwww.salomehotel.com. Decent small hotel 
that stands directly beside the Mariam (and so 
often serves as overﬂow). Again the rooms are airy

The Town
Although most visitors rush into Madaba to view the mosaic map and rush 
out again, the town is crammed with other mosaics, many of them more 
complete than the map and most more aesthetically pleasing. Within the central 
maze of streets is a large area of excavated mosaics dubbed the Archeological 
Park, while a small museum and the grand mosaic floor of the Church of 
the Apostles both lie a short stroll to the south. It's also worth taking time to 
explore the ancient tell rising above the old quarter: excavations are ongoing, 
but strolling these residential streets brings you past churches, old Ottoman-era 
houses and a fascinating slice of ordinary Madaba community life.
As well as mosaics, Madaba is known for its carpets. If you're in the market for 
such items, you'll find that prices are more reasonable, and quality often better, 
than in Amman. Many places in the town still weave carpets on traditional upright 
handlooms (although these days all the actual weaving is done by Egyptian 
employees). For other local crafts, Haret Jdoudna, a complex of small shops with 
a restaurant set round an attractive courtyard off Talal Street, merits a wander.
and spacious, though they don't have quite the 
character of its neighbour. 3
St George's Church T05 324 4984. In an annexe 
beside the Greek Orthodox "Church of the Map" is 
accommodation intended for pilgrims and those 
committed to ﬁnancially and spiritually beneﬁting 
the church and its afﬁliated school. The spick-and-
span rooms - all of them en suite - are ranged 
around an upper-level gallery of a brilliant white 
internal courtyard more reminiscent of Tangier than 
Madaba. There is no charge, but you're expected to 
make a proportionate donation.

The Church of the Map
Madaba's prime attraction is a remarkable Byzantine mosaic map of the Holy 
Land, housed in the nineteenth-century St George's Church (Mon-Thurs 
& Sat 8.30am-6pm, Fri & Sun 10.30am-6pm; winter closes 5pm; JD1; 
Wwww.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad). Although hyped a little excessively 
- and thus suffering from over a thousand visitors a day in the high season - 
the map is well worth seeing, notwithstanding the cramped space inside the 
church. To one side of the church entrance is an interpretation room, where 
you could eavesdrop on tour guides briefing their groups on the history and 
layout of the map.
Although there is no evidence of a date of composition, or the identity of the 
artist, the map was laid in the second half of the sixth century, in a Byzantine 
church that stood on the same site as the modern one but was possibly much 
larger; two of the original columns survive outside in the churchyard. The map 
is oriented to the east, its front edge being the Mediterranean coast, with north 
lying to the left.
Its size and style both mark it out as special. What survives today are 
fragments of the original, which comprised over two million stones, measured 
an enormous 15.6m long by 6m wide and depicted virtually the entire Levant, 
from Lebanon in the north to the Nile Delta in the south, and from the 
Mediterranean coast to the open desert. 
Other, simpler, mosaic renderings of cities and towns - and even mosaic maps 
- have been uncovered around the region, but the Madaba map is unique in 
depicting the larger towns and cities with an oblique perspective, as if from 
a vantage point high above to the west: what you see of Jerusalem, Karak, Gaza 
and Nablus is the outside of the western city wall and the inside of the eastern 
one, with buildings inside shown accurately in 3D-style, as if the mosaicist 
intended to produce a city plan.
Indeed, the whole, novel purpose of laying a map on the floor of the church 
may have been - in addition to glorifying God's works in the lands of the Bible 
- to better direct pilgrims to sites of biblical significance. Although there are 
some inaccuracies, the mapmaker has reproduced settlements and geographical 
features very precisely and, even by today's standards, the work is mostly carto-
graphically correct.
Jerusalem
What you come to first, as you walk up the aisle of the church, is Jerusalem, 
the "centre of the world" and the map's largest city, oval-shaped and labelled in 
red ΗΑΓΙΑ ΠΟΛΙC ΙΕΡΟΥCΑ[ΛΗΜ] (The Holy City of Jerusalem). The six 
The Miracle of the Blue Hand
St George's Church is the focus of Madaba's Greek Orthodox community, and 
services are held there every week, with carpets laid over the precious mosaic to 
protect it. One Sunday morning in 1976, worshippers passed in front of one of the 
church's many icons as normal, praying and touching it. Later in the service, 
someone chanced to look at the icon again - a picture of the Virgin and Child, which 
had been in full public view for years - and noticed that it had suddenly "grown" a 
third, blue hand, unseen by the full congregation an hour or so before. No one had 
an explanation, and it was declared to be a miracle, the Virgin showing Madaba a 
helping hand. The celebrated icon, still with its blue hand, is now on public display 
behind glass in the crypt.
THE KING'S HIGHWAY | Madaba

227
Byzantine gates of the city are shown in their exact locations and all survive to 
this day, including - at the northern edge of the city, marked by a tall column - 
the Damascus Gate (in Arabic, Bab al-Amud, or Gate of the Column). The 
long, colonnaded cardo maximus runs from here due south to the Zion Gate. 
In the western wall of the city, the only breach is for the Jaffa Gate, from which 
the decumanus (today's David St) runs east to join the cardo, with a dogleg 
hooking south behind the Citadel. Of Jerusalem's many churches, the biggest is 
the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, a centrally located complex of buildings 
topped with a red roof and the Dome of the Resurrection. At the southern end 
of the cardo is the New Church of the Mother of God, with a double yellow 
doorway; this was consecrated on November 20, 542, which helps in dating the 
Madaba map. Outside the walls to the southeast, a large patch of damage 
obscures everything up to the Dead Sea, but the four letters ΓΗΘC (GETHS) 
indicate the garden of Gethsemane.
The rest of Palestine
North of Jerusalem, a badly charred section conceals Nablus, identified as 
ΝΕΑΠΟΛΙC (Neapolis). From here, if you look between the pews against the 
left-hand wall of the church, you'll find an isolated fragment of mosaic showing 
a patch of modern-day Lebanon, giving an idea of the full extent of the original 
map. To the east of Nablus lies Jericho (ΙΕΡΙΧω), shown face on, surrounded 
by palm trees. Nearby, a small watchtower guards a crossing for rope-drawn 
ferries across the River Jordan - one fish swims downriver to a salty death in 
the Dead Sea, while another tries frantically to swim against the current. On the 
east bank, a gazelle flees from a lion (obliterated in antiquity). Just below is an 
enclosed spring marked "Ainon, where now is Sapsafas" (ΑΙΝωΝ ΕΝΘΑ ΝΥΝ 
Ο CΑΠCΑΦΑC), the location of the Baptism Site of Jesus.
West of Jerusalem are crowded more place names and biblical references, 
including, outside the southwestern corner of the city, the "field of blood" 
(ΑΚΕΛ ΔΑΜΑ), bought with Judas Iscariot's thirty pieces of silver (Matthew 
27). The nearest major town is the unwalled Lod (ΛωΔ); just below, in large red 
letters, is marked the allocation of land to the tribe of Dan ([ΚΛΗ]ΡΟC ΔΑΝ). 
Below, and to the left of the patch of damage, is a tiny red-domed building, with 
the Mediterranean Sea beyond; this was one of the possible locations for 
Jonah's being thrown up onto dry land out of the belly of the whale - ΤΟ ΤΥ
ΑΓΙΥ ΙωΝΑ (The [sanctuary] of St Jonah).
To the south of Jerusalem, on the edge of the surviving mosaic, lies 
Bethlehem (ΒΗΘΛΕΕΜ), shown surprisingly small compared to less 
important towns. Due south is the land of Judah (ΙΟΥΔΑ). Hard up against the 
pillar of the church is the sacred tree of Abraham (Genesis 18), identified as Η
ΔΡΥC ΜΑΜ[ΒΡΗ] (the oak of Mambre) near Hebron.
The Dead Sea, Transjordan and the Nile
Central to the map is the long, sausage-shaped Dead Sea, with shipping 
indicating trade links in antiquity. Of the two boats, the left one is being rowed 
with a cargo of what seems to be salt. The right one has an open sail and a 
yellowish cargo, which might be wheat. The detail of both crews, though, has 
been obliterated by iconoclasts. On the northeastern shore of the sea are the hot 
springs of Callirhoë (ΘΕΡΜΑ ΚΑΛΛΙΡΟΗC) at the outflow of the Wadi Zarqa 
Ma'in, showing pools and flowing water. To the east, all that remains of Trans-
jordan is a stretch of mountainous land reaching out as far as Karak
([ΧΑΡ]ΑΧΜωΒ[Α] or Kharakh-Moba, the fortress of Moab), fortified and 
isolated on its hilltop. On the southeastern tip of the sea, near Zoora (ΖΟΟΡΑ), 
THE KING'S HIGHWAY | Madaba

228
is Lot's Cave (ΤΟ ΤΥ ΑΓΙΥ Λ[ωΤ]), a church commemorating the site where 
Lot was drunkenly seduced by his two daughters. The four letters ΕΡΗΜ are 
the beginning of the Greek word for "desert".
The final section of the map is the most difficult to relate to reality. Against 
the right-hand wall of the church curl the arms of the Nile delta; however, 
instead of flowing from south to north, the Nile is depicted as flowing from east 
to west. In order to squeeze the river onto his strictly rectangular map, and also 
to keep faith with the notion of all the Rivers of Paradise - the Nile being one 
of them - flowing from the east (Genesis 2), the mosaicist used artistic licence 
to twist things around. The major city of the region is Gaza ([Γ]ΑΖΑ), on the 
westernmost edge of the surviving map, intricately depicted with walls, towers, 
streets and buildings.
The Archeological Park
A short stroll round the back of St George's Church will bring you to Hussein 
bin Ali Street and the Burnt Palace. A sixth-century patrician mansion, the 
palace was destroyed by fire early in the seventh century; its large floor mosaics 
include an image of the Roman city-goddess Tyche and several hunting scenes. 
Also within this area is a swathe of second-century Roman road and the 
Martyrs' Church, which has fine floor mosaics.
Barely 100m southeast is the impressive Archeological Park (daily 8am-
6pm; JD2 joint ticket with Church of the Apostles and Madaba Museum). It 
houses some of the most striking mosaic images in the country and is well 
worth an hour. Left of the ticket office hangs a Hellenistic-period mosaic, the 
oldest discovered in Jordan, taken from Herod's palace at Mukawir. Walking 
right past more mosaics brings you to an open plaza; follow the catwalk over a 
stretch of diagonally paved Roman road (some 2m below the present road 
surface) to reach the well-worn mosaic floor of the ruined Church of the 
Prophet Elias, dated to 607/8, and, below it, the tiny Crypt of Elianos, from 
595/6.
Cross over the Roman road again to the fine Hippolytus Hall mosaic, 
housed beneath a protective hangar. Dating from the early sixth century, 
probably from the reign of Justinian, the mosaic lay in what must have been a 
breathtakingly lavish private house. Less than a century later, though, the house 
was demolished and the mosaics buried to make way for the construction of 
the adjacent Church of the Virgin. Closest to the doorway is a diamond grid 
showing birds and plants. Next to this, and damaged by the foundations of an 
ancient wall, is a panel depicting the myth of Phaedra and Hippolytus; an 
almond-eyed Phaedra, sick with love for her stepson Hippolytus, is supported 
by two handmaidens and awaits news of him with a falconer in attendance (the 
image of Hippolytus himself has been lost). Above is a riotous scene. To the 
right, a bare-breasted Aphrodite, sitting on a throne next to Adonis, is spanking 
a winged cupid with a sandal; all around, the Three Graces and a servant girl 
have their hands full dealing with several more mischievous cupids, one of 
which is upsetting a basket of petals. Outside the acanthus-leaf border of the 
main mosaic - itself decorated with hunting scenes of leopards, lions and bears 
- are three women, personifications of (from the left) Rome, Gregoria and 
Madaba, seated next to a couple of hideous sea monsters.
The stepped catwalk leads you on to overlook the circular nave of the Church 
of the Virgin. Just discernible around the edge of the main mosaic are images 
of flowers dating from the construction of the church, in the late sixth century. 
Most of what is now visible dates from a geometric redesign completed in 767, 
during the Muslim Abbasid period. Swirls, knots and endlessly twisting patterns

The mosaics of Jordan
Hundreds of ﬂoor-laid mosaics in stone have survived in Jordan, from a ﬁrst-century 
BC example at Herod's palace at Mukawir (now on display in Madaba) through to 
pieces from the eighth century AD, when Christian mosaicists were still at work 
under the Muslim caliphate. Speciﬁc styles were used for places of worship and for 
civilian buildings, whether public baths, private mansions or the palaces and hunting 
lodges of the Umayyads. During the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian, for 
example, a retro taste for classical motifs was popular: many secular buildings were 
decorated with scenes taken from Greek and Roman mythology. Churches, of 
course, couldn't be decorated with the same pagan designs, but in addition to 
dedicatory inscriptions recording names of bishops and benefactors, and Christian 
symbols such as the lamb and the ﬁsh, Classical-style personiﬁcations of the 
sea, the earth and the seasons appeared on church ﬂoors throughout Jordan. These 
church mosaics served to dazzle and awe visitors to the house of God and, in an 
age of almost universal illiteracy, to teach the events of the Bible pictorially; the 
many representations of buildings and great cities may also have served as a 
rudimentary atlas.
Mosaic artists worked from pattern-books compiled in regional cultural centres, 
above all Constantinople. One result of this common artistic heritage is the predomi-
nance of pastoral scenes - which, in provincial backwaters such as Transjordan, also 
represented the reality of daily agricultural life for many people. The regularly 
recurring watery vignettes of ducks, boats and ﬁsh were rooted in a classical taste 
for representations of life on the Nile, and hunting scenes, often featuring lions, 
leopards and other extraordinary creatures, grew out of the Roman practice of 
capturing wild beasts for amphitheatre sports. In addition, Transjordanian mosaicists 
portrayed in detail an encyclopedia of ﬂora and fauna, drawn from local experience, 
the tales of travellers (elephants, crocodiles and octopus), and the realms of imagina-
tion (sea monsters and phoenixes).
However, the controversy in the eighth and ninth centuries concerning the 
depiction of people which raged across Byzantium and Transjordan - then already 
in the control of the Muslim armies - led to many mosaics being disﬁgured. What 
was under attack, from iconoclasts both Byzantine and Umayyad, was, at heart, 
polytheism. For centuries, Christians in the East had been venerating religious 
images in paint, stone and mosaic in a way that more ascetic elements in the 
Byzantine hierarchy considered too close for comfort to antique paganism. In 726 
Emperor Leo III banned the use of icons in worship. In Transjordan, under Umayyad 
control, a parallel movement within Islam had just as much practical impact. The 
Prophet Muhammad is reported to have taught that God is the only creator; inter-
preting this to imply that human "creation" of images of living creatures was 
blasphemous, the Umayyad caliph Yazid II (719-24) issued a directive to destroy all 
depictions of people - and, by extension, animals - throughout the Muslim empire. 
Transjordan's mosaicists had no choice but to obliterate with blank stones all 
images of people and animals in existing mosaics. Sometimes they did this with 
care, but it seems they were often in a panic: many of Jordan's mosaics now feature 
surreal clouds of haze hanging over what were once portraits. Some mosaics 
survived unscathed by having been buried in earlier years; others, laid after the order 
was given, avoided the issue by remaining studiously abstract. After 120 years of 
bitter controversy, the Christian ban was rescinded, but the Muslim injunction 
remained and still applies today.
Madaba is keeping its mosaic tradition alive: alongside the Archeological Park in 
the town centre stands the Madaba Institute for Mosaic Art and Restoration, or 
MIMAR (T05 324 0723), where students learn how to restore ancient mosaics as well 
as create their own designs. Call ahead for a tour of their workshops.

encircle a central medallion, with an inscription urging the congregation to 
"purify mind, flesh and works" before looking on Mary.
The catwalk delivers you to a small colonnaded courtyard next to the hangar, 
hung with more mosaics, some from nearby Ma'in. There are depictions of 
Hesban and Gadaron (Salt), but the most interesting piece is over in the far 
corner. A mosaic picture of an ox has been lovingly obliterated with a tree (all 
that remains are hooves and a tail); similar care was taken in disfiguring many 
of the mosaic images in and around Madaba, implying that much iconoclasm 
was effected by local artists working under orders, rather than by religious 
zealots charging through the town destroying whatever they saw.
Church of the Apostles
At the corner of Nuzha Street and the King's Highway lies the Church of the 
Apostles (daily 8am-6pm; JD2 joint ticket with Archeological Park and 
Madaba Museum), housed beneath a large and graceful new arched building.
The church itself was a huge 24m by 15m basilica with a couple of side-
chapels, built in 568, the high point of the Madaba school of mosaic art. The 
centrepiece of the mosaic is a personification of the sea, a spectacular portrait 
of a composed, regal woman emerging from the waves, surrounded by jumping 
fish, sharks, sea monsters and even an octopus. She holds a rudder up beside her 
face and is making a curious, undefinable hand gesture. The main body of the 
mosaic features pairs of long-tailed parrots; the acanthus-leaf border is filled 
with animals (a crouching cat, a wolf, a hen with her chicks) and boys at play. 
In the corners are distinctive, chubby human faces.
Madaba Museum
Just off Nuzha Street, southwest of the town centre, the small Madaba 
Museum (daily 8am-6pm; JD2 joint ticket with Archeological Park and 
Church of the Apostles) is worth a quick look. Nestled in a residential courtyard, 
the museum buildings were formerly houses themselves and feature mosaics 
uncovered by the residents during modern renovation work. Down some steps 
is a partly damaged mosaic featuring a naked satyr prancing in a Bacchic proces-
sion (although Bacchus himself is missing). Through an arch and to the right is 
the al-Masri house, with a mosaic showing a man's head and pairs of animals 
between fruit trees. Outside, steps lead down to the museum rooms, with 
pottery and coins discovered at local sites, but the most appealing exhibit is at 
the very back - the tiny chapel of the Twal house, laid with an exquisite 
mosaic floor featuring a lamb nibbling at a tree. Climb the steps back up to a 
quiet courtyard at the top, where there's a mosaic pavement from Hesban and 
open views across the roofs and fields.
Eating and drinking
The best restaurant in town - in fact, one of the best in the country - is A Haret 
Jdoudna (daily 11am-midnight; T05 324 8650, Wwww.haretjdoudna.com & 
Wwww.romero-jordan.com), about 100m south of the Church of the Map. The 
restaurant (whose name means "Courtyard of our Forefathers") comprises two 
old houses beside each other, one with an elegant cross-vaulted interior dating 
from 1905, the other with its original colourful floor-tiles imported from Haifa 
in 1923; perhaps the most pleasant place to eat is in the quiet courtyard between 
the two. A mere JD10-12 will buy you a meal of superb Arabic food in a tasteful, 
atmospheric setting; cold mezze highlights are the jibneh bil zaatar (goat's cheese 
in thyme), the vegetarian warag aynab and excellent muhammara, while the hot 
mezze include stuffed mushrooms and sambousek (pastry filled with meat or 
THE KING'S HIGHWAY | Madaba

231
cheese). As well as kebabs, there's a choice of chicken- or hummus-based fatteh. 
This is a popular out-of-town choice for gourmet Ammanis, and bookings are 
essential for Thursdays and Fridays.
Otherwise, the rooftop restaurant at the Mariam hotel is a fine choice for 
keenly priced home-cooked specialities including soups, kebabs and roast 
chicken. For simpler fare, there are strings of cheap diners along Nuzha Street 
near the museum and also Yarmouk Street. The Ayola coffee shop, opposite the 
Church of the Map, has bedouin-style decor and an English menu, but 
nonetheless draws some locals for its snacks and drinks. Two large restaurants 
that are geared mainly towards tour groups are the Dana, just up from the 
Church of the Apostles (T05 324 5749) and El Cardo, opposite the Archeolog-
ical Park (T05 325 1006). Both do buffets of Arabic staples when there's a 
group in, and offer à la carte choices for around JD10 per head.
Mount Nebo
About 10km northwest of Madaba, a series of peaks referred to collectively as 
MOUNT NEBO (in Arabic, Siyagha) comprise one of the holiest sites in 
Jordan, with a unique resonance for Jews, Christians and Muslims alike. Having 
led the Israelites for forty years through the wilderness, Moses finally saw, from 
this dizzy vantage point, the Promised Land that God had forbidden him to 
enter; after he died on the mountain, his successor Joshua went on to lead the 
Israelites across the river into Canaan. In Christian and Jewish tradition, Moses 
was buried somewhere on or in Mount Nebo, but Muslims (who regard Moses 
as a prophet) hold that his body was carried across the river and placed in a 
tomb now lying off the modern Jericho-Jerusalem highway. The lack of earthly 
remains on Nebo, though, doesn't temper the drama accompanying a visit: the 
mountain, and the church on its summit, feel so remote - and the view is so 
awe-inspiring - that the holiness of the place is almost tangible. Besides, the 
marvellous mosaics on display in the church would be reason enough in 
themselves to visit.
The Moses Memorial Church
The focus of a visit is the Moses Memorial Church (daily 8am-6pm; winter 
closes 4pm; JD1). The first structure on this site may have dated from classical 
times, but by 394 AD it had been converted into a triapsidal church floored 
with mosaics. The church was expanded during the sixth century and later, until 
it became the focus for a large and flourishing monastic community; the 
monastery is known to have been still thriving in 1217, but by 1564 it had been 
abandoned. In 1933, the ruined site was purchased by Franciscans, who began 
excavating and restoring the church and the surrounding area. Today, Siyagha 
(originally Aramaic for "monastery") remains both a monastic refuge and the 
headquarters of the energetic Franciscan Archeological Institute (Wwww
.custodia.org/fai).
Extensive renovation work was completed in 2009: at the time of writing, it 
wasn't clear exactly what the layout of the redesigned complex would be. As 
you walk through to the church entrance, you'll come to a cliff-edge platform 
beneath a huge, stylized cross in the form of a serpent - inspired by Jesus' words 
There's a map of the King's Highway on p.220.
THE KING'S HIGHWAY | Mount Nebo

232
in John 3: "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of 
Man be lifted up". From here, a panoramic view of the Land of Milk and 
Honey takes in the northern shore of the Dead Sea, the dark stripe of the River 
Jordan in its valley, Jericho on the opposite bank and, haze permitting, the 
towers on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem amid the hills opposite.
Within the church, to the left is the Old Baptistry, which boasts the most 
entertaining of all the mosaics in and around Madaba. Completed in August 
531, it was rediscovered in 1976, when the mosaic which had been laid over it 
in 597 (now hung on the wall) was removed for cleaning. The huge central 
panel features four beautiful and intricately designed tableaux. At the top, a 
tethered zebu is protected by a shepherd fighting off a huge lion, and a soldier 
lancing a lioness. Two mounted hunters with dogs are spearing a bear and a wild 
boar. Below, things are more peaceful, as a shepherd sits under a tree watching 
his goat and fat-tailed sheep nibble at the leaves. Closest to the catwalk, a dark-
skinned Persian has an ostrich on a leash, while a boy next to him is looking 
after a zebra and an extraordinary creature that is either a spotted camel or a 
creatively imagined giraffe.
The main hall of the church is divided by columns into a nave and aisles and 
(at any rate, before the renovation works) was adorned with mosaic panels 
including some from the Church of St George at Mukhayyat (see below), 
showing peacocks, a lion and other animals. One, featuring doves and a deer 
around a date palm, dates from 536 and has, on one side, the name Saola in 
Greek and, on the other, either the same name in old Aramaic script, or - some 
historians claim - the word bislameh ("with peace") in Arabic; were the latter to 
be correct, this would be the earliest example of Arabic script found in Jordan, 
predating Islam by a full century. However, due to the similar formation of 
letters in the two languages, it's impossible to be certain.
In another part of the church, what was formerly a funerary chapel became 
the New Baptistry in 597, also hosting several mosaics, while the apse of the 
Theotokos (Virgin Mary) Chapel, which was added to the main building 
in the seventh century, features a stylized representation of the Temple of 
Jerusalem and a perfect and endearingly bright-eyed gazelle, complete with a 
little bell around its neck.
Practicalities
Buses and serveeces from central Madaba go as far as the village of FAYSALI-
YYEH, 2km short of Mount Nebo. To get to the church, you'll either have to 
walk it, offer the bus driver a bit extra to take you on, or wait instead at Madaba 
bus station for one of the less frequent buses to Shuneh al-Janubiyyeh in the 
Jordan Valley, which run past the gates of Mount Nebo. Getting a taxi to take 
you from Madaba to Mount Nebo, wait, and bring you back shouldn't cost 
more than JD12-15, a little more if you include other sites.
Beyond the church gates, the road plunges off the back of Mount Nebo in a 
series of switchbacks down to a point on the Amman-Dead Sea road, 1200m 
below. From Madaba, chartering a taxi for the return journey to the Baptism
Site (see p.137) will cost around JD25-30.
Near Mount Nebo
About 1km back along the road towards Madaba from Mount Nebo, a clutch 
of restaurants marks a road leading steeply down the hillside to AYOUN 
MUSA, the Springs of Moses, one of the reputed locations for Moses striking 
the rock and water gushing forth (the Ain Musa spring above Petra is another). 
The spring itself, marred by a modern pumping station, is overlooked by lush 
THE KING'S HIGHWAY | Mount Nebo

233
foliage and is set in beautiful countryside - the vineyards nearby produce some 
of Jordan's best wine - but aside from a couple of tiny ruined churches about 
ten minutes' walk beyond the spring, you'll find little of specific interest. All the 
mosaics discovered in the churches down here were long ago removed to 
Mount Nebo. Plans to build a cable car linking Ayoun Musa to Mount Nebo 
seem to have come to nothing.
Back on the main road, about 1km further brings you to the village of Faysali-
yyeh, and a turn to MUKHAYYAT, site of the biblical town of Nebo and 
home to five ruined churches and yet another outstanding mosaic. At the first 
fork, the older road (left) will bring you, after about 2km, to a small car park at 
the foot of a small but steep hill; on the summit sits the Church of Saints Lot 
and Procopius. A modern building protects the large, almost perfectly 
preserved floor mosaic, featuring bunches of grapes, tableaux of vine-harvesting 
and musically accompanied grape-treading, along with rabbit-chasing and lion-
hunting. The most entertaining pieces are between the column stumps: nearest 
the door are a fisherman and a man rowing a boat either side of a church, and 
two peculiar fish-tailed monsters, while opposite lie vignettes of geese and 
ducks in a pond full of fish and lily pads.
Visible on the hilltop beyond Saints Lot and Procopius, the ruined sixth-
century Church of St George occupies the highest peak on the mountain. Its 
mosaics are on display at Mount Nebo, but the view remains breathtaking. 
There are three more churches dotted around the valley nearby (the guardian 
can tell you where), but none has mosaics in situ.
Around Madaba
Even aside from Mount Nebo, the countryside around Madaba is packed 
with natural and historical attractions, ranging from the World Heritage 
Site of Umm ar-Rasas and the biblical ruins of Hesban to the luxury spa 
resort of Ma'in Hot Springs, ranged around a series of thermal waterfalls 
tumbling within an isolated canyon. Near the hot springs stands the excellent 
museum and restaurant at the remote Dead Sea Panorama complex, 
while on a King's Highway journey southwards, you might take the time 
to head into the hills to explore King Herod's ruined mountain-top palace 
at Mukawir.
Hesban
Beside the modern village of HESBAN, 9km north of Madaba and about 
22km southwest of Amman (signposted from Na'ur, off the Dead Sea highway), 
rises a huge tell - rarely visited, despite interesting ruins and good signage.
Remains testify to occupation from the Paleolithic Age onwards. In the 
thirteenth century BC, with the name Heshbon, this was "the city of Sihon, 
king of the Amorites" (Numbers 21). As the Israelites approached, they "sent 
messengers unto Sihon" seeking permission to pass through his territory "by 
the king's highway, until we be past thy borders". Sihon refused, and was 
defeated in battle by the Israelites, who then took up residence in Heshbon. 
After they departed to Canaan, the city was fortified by the Ammonites, 
abandoned, and then re-fortified in the second-century BC Hellenistic period. 
The Roman historian Josephus named Hesbus, or Esbus, as one of the cities 
strengthened by Herod the Great; by the second century AD it was flourishing, 
due to its position at the junction of the Via Nova Traiana and a transverse 
THE KING'S HIGHWAY | Around Madaba

234
Roman road connecting to Jericho and Jerusalem. From the fourth century, the 
city was an important Christian ecclesiastical centre, and remained a bishopric 
until after the Umayyad takeover. During the Abbasid period, after the eighth 
century, it became a pilgrims' rest-stop, and regained some significance as a 
regional capital under the Mamlukes in the fourteenth century. Hesban was 
repopulated in the 1870s by the local Ajarmeh bedouin, and remains a quiet 
agricultural village.
Buses run from Madaba and from Amman's Muhajireen station (via Na'ur); 
be sure to specify you want Hesban, since most Madaba-Amman buses follow 
a different road. The site guardian is happy to show visitors around.
Archeologists (see Wwww.madabaplains.org) recently uncovered a network of 
Iron Age caves which riddle the tell, leading to speculation concerning their 
possible connection to Moses and the Israelites; one particularly significant find 
was an unbroken pottery cup dating from 1200 BC - precisely the right period. 
On the summit are the fallen columns of a Byzantine church (its mosaic floor 
is now in the Madaba museum), as well as a Mamluke mosque, and baths with
furnace and plunge pools. Panoramic views extend west to Jericho and 
Jerusalem, north into Gilead, east to the desert highlands, and south to Dhiban 
and even Karak, bringing home the strategic value of the site.
Adventure excursions around Madaba and Ma'in
Thanks to the folded landscape of canyons, gorges, valleys and hills around Madaba, 
Mukawir and the Ma'in hot springs, there are some great opportunities for adventure 
trips and excursions. Although many of the Jordanian specialists listed on p.50 will 
be able to help, check ﬁrst with Terhaal (T05 325 1005, Wwww.terhaal.com), an 
excellent professional adventure activity ﬁrm based in Madaba, with intimate 
knowledge of these mountains and countryside. As an added enticement, several of 
Terhaal's full-day trips include a meal hosted by a local family - a unique opportunity 
to sample rural village life and authentic home cooking.
Among Terhaal's wide range of trips, detailed on its website, are relatively short, 
easy gorge-walking excursions down Wadi Waleh or Wadi Karak, as well as long, 
difﬁcult canyoning adventures in Wadi Manshala, Wadi Mukheiris and others. One 
popular route leads down the Wadi Zarqa Ma'in, from the Six Senses hotel to the 
Dead Sea shore at ancient Callirhoë (see p.135). Most of these are full-day trips, 
involving anything from six to twelve hours of walking, canyoning, swimming 
through deep pools and, sometimes, abseiling down waterfalls. Expect to pay 
JD50-70 per person for the more straightforward trips; two or three times that for 
the tougher adventures. Bear in mind that the terrain is often difﬁcult: within the 
sweltering, breezeless gorges temperatures can soar and dehydration can strike 
even the most experienced of walkers. You need to be at least moderately ﬁt and 
carry lots of water. The Six Senses hotel also leads shorter hikes, up onto the cliffs 
around the Zarqa Ma'in valley; contact them for details. These walks and others 
are described in more detail in Jordan: Walks, Treks, Caves, Climbs & Canyons by 
Tony Howard (see p.404). 
The hills around Madaba are also perfect for mountain-biking and Terhaal offers 
several trips, including a full-day route from Madaba to Mukawir, as well as easy rides 
down to the Dead Sea and a half-day exploring dolmen ﬁelds. These run as 
scheduled trips (see website for dates; JD25-50 per person) and also on request.
Another option is to talk to the "Wild Jordan" team at the Royal Society for the 
Conservation of Nature (RSCN; see p.51) about trekking from the Six Senses hotel
over the hills into the neighbouring Mujib Nature Reserve (see p.241) for a day of 
sightseeing, hiking, swimming and birdwatching.
THE KING'S HIGHWAY | Around Madaba

235
Ma'in hot springs
About 30km southwest of Madaba, at the end of one of Jordan's steepest, most 
tortuous roads, MA'IN HOT SPRINGS (Hammamat Ma'in in Arabic) make 
for a great side-trip off the King's Highway. Continuously dousing the precipi-
tous desert cliffs of the Wadi Zarqa Ma'in with steaming water - varying 
between a cosy 40°C and a scalding 60°C - the springs (and the whole valley, 
which lies more than 250m below sea level) have long been popular with 
weekend day-trippers. The waters have been channelled to form hot water-
falls, there are hot spa pools, natural and artificial saunas, full spa facilities at the 
adjacent luxury hotel - but it's still not too hard to escape the melee and find 
a quiet, steamy niche in the rock all to yourself. If you're feeling energetic, 
hiking some or all of the way down the deep gorge to the Dead Sea is an 
exhilarating counterpoint to lying around in hot water all day. Bear in mind that 
Fridays, especially in spring and autumn, see the valley packed with day-trippers 
from Amman and Madaba.
At the time of writing there was no public transport serving the hot springs: 
the only option was to take a taxi from Madaba for around JD20 return (less if 
you book through the Mariam Hotel; see p.224). You may find the situation has 
changed when you visit; ask your hotel reception for the latest.
The approach road through Ma'in
The road from Madaba passes first through fields and the small farming 
community of MA'IN; the village, perched on its tell, is mentioned in the Bible, 
and excavations in its Byzantine- and Umayyad-period churches revealed many 
mosaics, now on display in the Madaba Archeological Park. Beyond Ma'in, the 
terrain dries out, and the road begins to heave and twist around the contours 
of land above the Dead Sea. Thin tracks off to the left give options for picnic 
spots on slopes perched high above cultivated sections of the Wadi Zarqa Ma'in; 
to the right, the views over the desert hills down to the fairy-tale Dead Sea, 
luminous blue in a valley of brown, are incredible. The road keeps coiling and 
recoiling in steep switchbacks until you come to a well-marked T-junction. 
Turning right here will bring you past the Dead Sea Panorama museum and 
restaurant (see p.134), and on down to the Dead Sea shore, while turning left 
leads steeply down over the cliff-edge of the Wadi Zarqa Ma'in gorge and on 
down, via a series of switchbacks, to the hot springs on the valley floor.
Two small archeological sites can be visited near Ma'in village with your own 
transport. About 1km before Ma'in village, if you fork left at an avenue of trees, 
after about 5km you'll come to MAGHEIRAT. Lines of Neolithic standing 
stones crisscross the road here; up on the hilltop to the right is a largely unexca-
vated stone circle in a double ring. Back at Ma'in village, if you turn left and head 
south through orchards into open country - increasingly covered with white dust 
from a nearby quarry - you'll see, on the left in an unguarded field, a Neolithic 
standing stone known as Hajar al-Mansub, carved (in antiquity) on its reverse side 
as an enormous phallus. Theories abound as to its purpose and context.
A mountain circuit
Likely to be completed by the time you read this will be a new, sealed road linking 
the Ma'in hot springs with Mukawir (see p.236), making it possible to follow a long, 
scenic and often very steep circuit of roads to and from Madaba - south along the 
King's Highway, up to Mukawir, down to the hot springs, up again (to the Dead Sea 
Panorama, for example) and back to Madaba.

The hot springs and spa complex
The road down off the clifftop leads to the main gate into the valley (daily 
6am-5pm), where non-hotel guests pay JD10 for access to the public pools, spa 
areas and waterfalls (there are also pools and waterfalls which are accessible only 
to guests of the hotel).
The hot waterfalls tumble down off the cliffs to one side of the valley, steam 
rising from a series of pools below, where you can sit and enjoy a shoulder-
pounding from the water. The two waterfalls nearest the hotel are public and 
open to all, as are nearby pools and seating areas, though you may find that some 
zones are reserved for "families" (which means solo men do not have access).
Sitting in mid-valley is the five-star Evason Ma'in Hot Springs hotel (T05 324 
5500, Wwww.sixsenses.com; 9), which includes a Six Senses Spa. Opened in 
2009, this is a super-luxury resort: rooms in the hotel are superbly presented - 
spacious and well designed in a chic Asian-influenced style, with stone floors 
and dark wood. Every room has a balcony. The hotel has its own secluded spa
zone slightly down the valley, away from the public areas, where you can 
indulge in a wide variety of spa treatments and massages. The only restaurants
are within the hotel, although alongside the public pools and seating areas you'll 
find places doing snacks, sandwiches and shawerma. The hotel charges non-
guests JD30 to access its private spa and other facilities - but may turn you away 
if they're busy.
Dead Sea Panorama
From the T-junction of roads before you descend to enter the gorge of the Wadi 
Zarqa Ma'in, it's a short drive to the well-signed Dead Sea Panorama, which 
includes the excellent Dead Sea Museum, viewpoints and a fine restaurant. The 
complex is covered in detail on p.134. The same road continues past the 
Panorama, descending in a series of hairpin turns down to the Dead Sea 
shoreline road.
Mukawir
The King's Highway heads south from Madaba through quiet, picturesque 
farmland for 13km to Libb, where a well-signed road branches right for a long, 
slow 20km across the windblown hilltops to the small village of MUKAWIR
(pronounced "m-KAA-whirr"), views yawning away in all directions. The main 
reason for visiting is to make the short hike up to the isolated conical hill 
beyond the village, which is topped with the ruins of the palace of Machaerus, 
where Salome danced for King Herod, and where John the Baptist was 
beheaded.
During the first century BC, the hill was a stronghold of the Jewish 
Hasmonean revolt against the Seleucids, and was fortified to be a buffer against 
Nabatean power further south. In the last decades of that century, Herod the 
Great, king of Judea, constructed a walled citadel at Machaerus and developed 
road access to the site from the Dead Sea port at Callirhoë, 8km west, although 
trade on the King's Highway - just 22km east - remained under the control of 
the Nabateans. According to the Roman historian Josephus, it was at Machaerus 
that Salome danced her famously seductive dance for the head of John the 
Baptist (see box, opposite).
In 66 AD, during a Jewish revolt against Roman rule, the rebels seized 
Machaerus and held it for seven years, eventually surrendering when faced by 
Roman forces preparing to assault the fortress (in an almost identical situation 
at Masada, west of the Dead Sea, a Jewish resistance force committed mass 
THE KING'S HIGHWAY | Around Madaba

237
suicide rather than submit). The Romans immediately moved into Machaerus, 
razed the buildings, massacred the local civilian population and departed. The 
hill has remained quiet since.
Today, a visit is more likely to entice for the truly awe-inspiring views and the 
beautiful, rolling countryside, carpeted with wildflowers in spring, than for the 
archeology. Kestrels wheel against the Dead Sea haze above a handful of 
gleaming modern columns which sprout from the part-excavated rubble on the 
hilltop. Of the palace ruins, a few rooms are discernible, as are the remains of 
the Roman assault ramp on the far slopes of the hill and the line of an 
aqueduct across the saddle. A mosaic - the oldest discovered in Jordan - once 
lay in the baths complex, but has been removed to Madaba for display.
Occasional buses run from Madaba to Mukawir village. You may be able to 
persuade the driver to take you the extra 2km to the car park opposite the hill; 
if not, it's a pleasant walk. From the car park, a steep but easy fifteen-minute 
climb across the saddle and up some steps brings you to the hilltop ruins, known 
gloomily to the locals as Qal'at al-Meshneqeh ("Citadel of the Gallows").
Bani Hamida centre
The Mukawir area is the homeland of the Bani Hamida tribe, now well 
known in Jordan following the success of a highly publicized project to revive 
traditional weaving skills among the women of the tribe, providing them and 
their families with an additional source of income and vocational training possi-
bilities. On the outskirts of Mukawir village is the Bani Hamida centre
(hours variable, but normally Sun-Thurs 8am-2pm), sister outlet to the shop in 
Amman (see p.119), where you can buy beautiful rugs, wall-hangings and other 
knick-knacks. As you'd expect for high-quality handmade goods, nothing is 
cheap - but you're free to watch the women weaving and there's absolutely no 
pressure to buy; however, if you fancy splashing out, you can be certain that 
what you're getting is the genuine article.
Umm ar-Rasas
A small farming village on a backroad midway between the King's Highway 
and the Desert Highway, UMM AR-RASAS was the site of the Roman 
garrison town of Kastron Mefaa, which developed during the Byzantine and 
Umayyad periods into a relatively important city: large mosaic floors from 
some of its many churches survive and are on display. Nearby is a striking Stylite 
Salome's dance
In an act forbidden under Jewish law, Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great, 
married his brother's wife (named Herodias). When he was publicly accused of 
adultery by a local holy man named John the Baptist, Herod had the troublemaker 
arrested and imprisoned at Machaerus. Some time later, at a birthday celebration in 
the Machaerus palace, Herod was so impressed by the dancing of Salome, 
Herodias' daughter, that he promised her anything she wanted. Salome, prompted 
by her mother (who wanted rid of the holy man), requested John's head on a platter 
- and Herod obliged.
Christian tradition holds that John was buried where he died, in a well-signposted 
cave near the hill, but Islam, according to which John (or Yahya in Arabic) is a 
prophet, keeps two shrines holy, one for his body (the same cave) and another in 
Damascus for his severed head, which was supposedly taken to that city and buried 
where the Great Mosque now stands.

tower. Although archeologically significant, the site is a minor attraction - 
worth a detour if you have your own transport.
A Visitor Centre stands alongside the (fenced) ruins: follow trails which lead 
through the ancient city - past buildings and arches - to a modern shelter 
protecting the mosaics. Well-designed catwalks lead you over the intricate 
mosaic floor of the Church of St Stephen, dated to 785, over 150 years after 
Muslim rule was established in Jordan. The apse has a dazzling kaleidoscopic 
diamond pattern swirling out from behind the altar, and the broad nave is 
framed by mosaic panels showing cities of the day: closest to the door is 
Jerusalem, with seven Palestinian cities below, including Nablus, Asqalan and, at 
the bottom, Gaza. On the far side are seven Transjordanian cities, headed by 
Kastron Mefaa itself, with Philadelphia (Amman), Madaba, Hesban, Ma'in, 
Rabba and Karak below. The central section is filled with scenes of fishermen, 
seashells, jellyfish and all kinds of intricate detail of animals, fruit and trees, 
although in antiquity iconoclasts blocked out virtually all representations of 
people. Alongside is an older mosaic belonging to the Church of Bishop 
Sergius, dated to 587. Its main feature is a rectangular panel in front of the altar 
featuring pomegranate trees and very wise-looking rams; on the other side of 
the catwalk, hard up against the exterior wall, a beautifully executed personifi-
cation of one of the seasons survived the iconoclasts by having had a pulpit built 
over it at some point.
Attractive though they are, Umm ar-Rasas's mosaics are only half the story; 
don't leave without standing awhile at the foot of the village's peculiar square 
tower, 1km away from the ruins and represented on the church floor by 
Kastron Mefaa's own mosaicists as an identifying feature of their city. Windblown 
and mysterious, the fifteen-metre tower (known in Arabic as Burj Sam'an) is 
solid, without internal stairs, yet at the top is a room with windows in four 
directions. Rough crosses are carved on the three sides facing away from the 
city, but details of intricate carving survive on the topmost corbels. This would 
seem to have been the Stylite tower of a Christian holy man; the fifth-century 
ascetic Simon Stylites spent 38 years atop a pillar near Aleppo, and a cult of 
pilgrimage grew up around him and later imitators who isolated themselves 
from worldly distractions in order to concentrate on their prayers. At the foot 
of the tower once stood a church; nearby are cisterns and a building which may 
have been a hostel for pilgrims. Today, almost wrenched apart by earthquakes, 
the tower is home only to pigeons and kestrels, and stands sheathed in 
supportive scaffolding. Restoration may be complete when you visit.
Practicalities
The only buses to Umm ar-Rasas run a few times daily from Madaba, on back 
roads via NITIL - this route is also driveable (reckon on 32km or so), though 
complicated: you may have to ask directions from locals here and there. The 
easier driving route is to turn east off the King's Highway in Dhiban (see 
below): this road leads after 16km to Umm ar-Rasas, and after another 14km to 
a marked junction on the Desert Highway.
Wadi Mujib and around
One of Jordan's most spectacular natural features lies midway between Madaba 
and Karak - the immense Wadi Mujib, dubbed, with a canny eye on the 
tourist dollar, "Jordan's Grand Canyon". The name, however, is well earned, as 
the King's Highway delivers you to stunning viewpoints on either rim over a

vast gash in the barren landscape, cutting through 1200m of altitude from the 
desert plateau in the east down to the Dead Sea in the west. It is every bit as 
awe-inspiring as its Arizonan cousin and has the added selling-point of the 
memorable road journey winding down to the valley floor and up the other 
side. A large chunk of the surrounding territory now forms part of the protected 
Mujib Nature Reserve, offering the chance for wilderness hiking and 
canyoning as good as any you'll find in the Middle East.
South to Dhiban
South of Madaba, the first of a series of large wadis slicing west-east across 
southern Jordan is the lush Wadi Wala, a little beyond Libb - pleasantly dotted 
with vineyards and shaded by groves of pine and eucalyptus. From the valley 
floor, you can drive west on a riverside road for some 15km into the quiet and 
beautiful Wadi Hidan. This road terminates in a dead end, but Hidan itself goes 
on to meet the Mujib River just before the Dead Sea; with a guide, it's possible 
to follow the river on foot for about 6km between basaltic cliffs up to the edge 
of an eighty-metre waterfall (which marks the start of an area off-limits to 
walkers), although you must then climb up the cliffside and make your way 
back to the road.
Back on the highway, when you reach the top of the southern slope of Wadi 
Wala, a stretch of the Roman Via Nova Traiana is visible on the valley floor 
behind. Some 10km further (33km south of Madaba), DHIBAN is the last 
town before the Mujib canyon. A signposted turn here heads east for 16km 
to Umm ar-Rasas (see p.237) and, after another 14km, the Desert Highway.
Apart from irregular student buses, there is no public transport through Wadi 
Mujib (although see p.121 for details of private tours from Amman, and p.224 
 The King's Highway winding down into Wadi Mujib

from Madaba): all southbound buses terminate at Dhiban. However, 
Dhibanis are well aware of foreigners' desire to travel through Mujib, and have 
a nice little earner going offering their pick-ups as taxis. Asking around at the 
shops on Dhiban's central roundabout for a ride through the canyon will 
quickly bear fruit; the going rate for a full car to Ariha, the first village on the 
southern rim, is around JD10. From Ariha, local buses continue south along the 
King's Highway to Karak.
Through the Wadi Mujib
Some 2km south of Dhiban, the vast canyon of the Wadi Mujib opens up 
spectacularly in front, over 500m deep and 4km broad at the top. Just over the 
lip of the gorge is a small rest stop and viewing platform. The dramatic canyon 
is an obvious natural focal point, and in biblical times, Arnon, as it was named, 
was the heartland of Moab, although with shifts in regional power it frequently 
marked a border between tribal jurisdictions; today, it divides the governorates 
of Madaba and Karak. The sheer scale of the place is what takes your breath 
away, with vultures, eagles and kestrels wheeling silently on rising thermals all 
around, and the valley floor to the right losing itself in the mistiness of the Dead 
Sea. The broad, flat plain of the wadi bed, now dammed, is noticeably hotter 
and creaks with frog calls.
After snaking up Mujib's southern slope, the King's Highway emerges onto 
the flat Moabite plateau, fields of wheat stretching off in all directions. The first 
village on the southern rim, about 3km from the gorge, is ARIHA, and from 
here the highway ploughs a straight furrow south through small farming 
communities to two towns nurturing minor remnants of a more glorious past. 
QASR, 12km south of Ariha, boasts a Nabatean temple east of the town, while 
The Mesha stele
These days a largely unregarded village, in the past Dhiban was an important city, 
capital of Moab and mentioned many times in the Old Testament. In around 850 BC, 
a man named Mesha, described as a "shepherd king", liberated Moab from Israelite 
aggression, built a palace in Dhiban and set about refortifying the King's Highway 
against future attack.
Almost three thousand years later, in 1868, a German missionary travelling in the 
wild country between Salt and Karak was shown by Dhibani bedouin a large basalt 
stone inscribed with strange characters. Unaware of its signiﬁcance, he nonetheless 
informed the German consul of his discovery, who then made quiet arrangements to 
obtain the stele on behalf of the Berlin Museum. However, a French diplomat in 
Jerusalem who heard of the discovery was less subtle; he travelled to Dhiban, took an 
imprint of the stele's text and there and then offered the locals a large sum of money. 
Suddenly ﬁnding themselves at the centre of an international furore over a seemingly 
very desirable lump of rock, the bedouin refused his offer and sent him packing; they 
then did the obvious thing and devised a way to make more money. By heating the 
stone over a ﬁre, then pouring cold water on it, they successfully managed to shatter 
it, and thus sell off each valuable fragment to the covetous foreigners one by one. 
Meanwhile, scholars in Europe were studying and translating the imprint of the text, 
which turned out to be Mesha's own record of his achievements, signiﬁcant as the 
longest inscription in the Moabite language and one of the longest and most detailed 
original inscriptions from the biblical period yet discovered. The mostly reconstructed 
stele now sits in the Louvre in Paris; having become something of a symbol of national 
pride, copies of it are displayed in museums all over Jordan.
THE KING'S HIGHWAY | Wadi Mujib and around

241
RABBA, 5km on - once an important Roman and Byzantine settlement - 
hosts the remains of a Roman temple west of the road behind the modern 
town. Midway between Qasr and Rabba, a side-turning gives access to hikes 
along the spectacular Wadi ibn Hammad (see box, p.242).
Mujib Nature Reserve
Much of the area between the King's Highway and the Dead Sea shore as far 
north as Ma'in, and including the lower 18km of the Mujib River, forms the 
MUJIB NATURE RESERVE (for more, see p.135; Wwww.rscn.org.jo). This 
swathe of diverse terrain extends from the hills alongside the King's Highway, 
at 900m above sea level, all the way down to the Dead Sea shore at 400m below 
sea level, and includes seven permanently flowing wadis within its 212 square 
kilometres. The biodiversity of this apparently barren area is startling: during 
ecological surveys of the reserve, four plant species never before recorded in 
Jordan were discovered, along with the rare Syrian wolf, Egyptian mongoose, 
Blanford's fox, caracal, striped hyena, two species of viper, the venomous desert 
cobra, and large numbers of raptors. Nubian ibex roam the mountains on 
Mujib's southern plateau. This is one of the most dramatic areas of natural 
beauty in Jordan - well worth the time and effort to experience.
The reserve's only base at the King's Highway end of the valley is a small office 
in FAQUA village (T03 231 3059), northwest of Qasr, but this is not geared 
up for enquiries. For all bookings and information, contact the RSCN's Wild 
Jordan tourism unit in Amman (see p.51), or call down to the main visitor
centre at the western end of the valley, down by the Mujib Bridge on the Dead 
Sea road (see p.135). Everything must be booked in advance, and all routes are 
closed during Ramadan.
Most of the reserve's hiking trails begin from the lower end of the reserve by 
the Dead Sea shore, outlined on p.135. An exception is the rugged Mujib trail
(15km; 7hr; JD40pp, minimum five people; Nov-March only), a difficult route 
that begins from Faqua and descends rapidly into the reserve proper, ending at 
the Raddas mountain ranger station. With advance planning it's possible to 
follow a request permission for a difficult full-day route from Faqua all the way 
to the Dead Sea (April-Oct only), following the Mujib River with deviations at 
obstacles and passing through wild and varied scenery. This links up with the 
Malaqi Trail (see p.135) at the confluence of the Wadi Hidan for the final stretch 
down through the stunning Mujib Siq. All routes require an RSCN guide.
See p.234 for details of similar routes outside the reserve, around Wadi Zarqa 
Ma'in and Mukawir. The box on p.242 outlines some routes further south 
around Karak, including the beautiful Wadi ibn Hammad.
Karak to Shobak
The southern stretches of the King's Highway pass through an increasingly arid 
landscape dotted with lushly watered settlements. Karak, southern Jordan's 
most important town, still lies largely within its Crusader-era walls and boasts 
one of the best-preserved castles in the Middle East. The deep canyon of Wadi 
THE KING'S HIGHWAY | Karak to Shobak

Hasa to the south, overlooked by an extinct volcano, runs a close second to 
Mujib for natural drama. From Tafileh a little beyond, the highway rises into 
the Shara mountains, well over 1500m above sea level (and considerably more 
above the deep Dead Sea rift to the west); up here are both the magnificent 
Dana Nature Reserve and another Crusader castle at Shobak. A little way 
south, the dry, jagged mountains conceal ancient Petra (see p.259).
Karak
A busy town atop an isolated hill still encircled by Crusader walls, KARAK is 
the unofficial capital of southern Jordan. Roughly midway between Amman 
and Petra, it's also a natural place to break a journey along the King's Highway. 
The huge and well-preserved Crusader castle which occupies the southern tip 
of the hill is one of the finest in the Middle East, second only to Syria's Krak 
des Chevaliers for explorability.
As well as the King's Highway passing north-south at Karak, major roads lead 
east to Qatraneh on the Desert Highway (see p.317) and west down to Mazra'a 
and Safi on the Dead Sea road, where the ancient site of Lot's Cave (see p.137) 
makes a good day-trip. Whether by bus or in your own car, the road heading 
west from Karak down to the Dead Sea (26km) is one of Jordan's great scenic
drives, especially in the afternoon, when low sunlight makes the walls of the 
steep Wadi Karak glow.
Some history
The hill on which Karak stands - with sheer cliffs on three sides and clear 
command over the Wadi Karak leading down to the Dead Sea - features both 
in the Old Testament and on Madaba's Byzantine mosaic map as a natural 
defensive stronghold. The Crusaders began building a fortress on a rocky spur 
atop the hill in 1142.
Adventure excursions around Karak
As well as trails around Madaba (see p.234) and others within the Mujib reserve (see 
p.241), there are several attractive canyons near Karak that are worth exploring. 
Many of the specialist guides listed on p.50 know some routes, as do Terhaal (T05
325 1005, Wwww.terhaal.com), an adventure company based in Madaba.
The full-day gorge-walk down the stunning Wadi ibn Hammad, 34km north of Karak, 
starts from a pool fed by a hot spring, accessed down a tortuous side-road midway 
between Qasr and Rabba. The canyon - brieﬂy subterranean initially - extends for 
12km down to the Dead Sea, 500m below, passing through beautiful mixed terrain, rich 
with palms, ferns and, in springtime, a breathtaking array of wildﬂowers. The only 
obstacle is a ﬁve-metre waterfall, located about 2km east of the Dead Sea road; the 
path around it leads right, up the cliffs, before descending to follow the lower river bed 
out to the Dead Sea road, where you can pick up buses between Mazra'a and Karak.
Wadi Numeira, south of the village of Al-Iraq, 34km south of Karak, is equally 
enjoyable. If you start from the end of the tarmac road in Al-Iraq, it's a hike of 18km 
(8hr), but you can cover the ﬁrst 5km of dirt track by 4x4, leaving 13km to do on foot 
(6hr). The route, which passes through a green canyon between barren mountains, 
climaxes in a narrow 100m gorge, bringing you out onto the Dead Sea road between 
Mazra'a and Saﬁ. You may need a rope for a 5m drop at one point.
These walks and others in the area are described in more detail in Jordan: Walks, 
Treks, Caves, Climbs & Canyons by Tony Howard (see p.404). 
THE KING'S HIGHWAY | Karak

The castle's construction was initiated by the knights of the successful First 
Crusade, but its eventual downfall is inextricably linked with the personalities 
of those who came later, specifically Reynald of Chatillon. A ruthless warrior 
who arrived in the Holy Land in 1147 on the Second Crusade, Reynald was 
both vicious and unscrupulous, and it was specifically to avenge his treachery 
that the Muslim commander, Salah ad-Din, launched a campaign to expel the 
foreign invaders. In 1177, Reynald married Lady Stephanie, widow of the Lord 
of Oultrejourdain. Safely ensconced in Karak, he began a reign characterized by 
wanton cruelty: one of his more notorious pleasures involved encasing the 
heads of his prisoners in wooden boxes so that, when he flung them off the 
castle walls, he could be sure that they hadn't lost consciousness by the time they 
hit the rocks below. In 1180, he robbed a Mecca-bound caravan on the King's 
Highway in violation of a truce; Salah ad-Din was forced to swallow his anger 
until a suitable time for revenge could be found.
In 1183, the wedding of Reynald's heir was celebrated within the walls of 
Karak castle at the very moment that Salah ad-Din and his army, having already

invaded the town, were poised just beyond the north moat ready to attack. Lady 
Stephanie sent plates of food from the banquet to the Muslim army beyond the 
walls; in response, while his men were trying to bridge the moat and catapulting 
rocks against the walls, Salah ad-Din enquired which tower the newly-weds 
were occupying. In an expression of his impeccable chivalry, he then ordered 
his army to direct their fire elsewhere.
Karak withstood that siege, but at the Battle of Hattin in 1187, the 
Crusaders, stymied by the strategic ineptitude of Reynald and others, were 
defeated. The victorious Salah ad-Din characteristically spared the king and the 
Crusader lords - all apart from Reynald, whom he personally decapitated. The 
besieged Crusader garrison at Karak held out for months; they sold their wives 
and children in exchange for food, and resorted to eating horses and dogs, but 
surrender was inevitable. Karak capitulated in November 1188.
Ayyubid and Mamluke occupiers of the castle rebuilt and strengthened its 
defences. Under the Ottomans, anarchy was the rule rather than the 
The Crusaders in Transjordan
Following an appeal from the Byzantine emperor for foreign military assistance to 
defeat the Seljuk Turks, it took only a few years from the pope's ﬁrst call to arms of 
1095 for invading Christian European armies to seize Jerusalem. European-run 
statelets were set up in quick succession throughout the Levant - the Kingdom of 
Jerusalem, the Counties of Tripoli and Edessa, and the Principality of Antioch. One 
of the Christian lords, Baldwin, was crowned King of Jerusalem on Christmas Day 
1100, and it was under his rule that the Crusaders began to realize the beneﬁt of 
controlling the Transjordanian land route from Syria into Egypt and Arabia, in order to 
stand between the Muslim power bases in Damascus and Cairo and to be able to 
harass Muslims making the pilgrimage to the Arabian holy places. In 1107, simply the 
threat of attack by Baldwin's army persuaded a Seljuk force to ﬂee their stronghold 
in Petra, and persistent harrying over a decade or more in the area around Ajloun
successfully played havoc with established trade patterns in the region. In 1115, 
Baldwin crossed the Wadi Araba from Hebron with the intention of fully incorporating 
Transjordan into the Crusader realms, and began construction of a large castle at 
modern Shobak, which he named Le Krak de Montreal ("Fortress of the Royal 
Mountain"). Establishment of a string of Crusader possessions soon followed, at Aila 
(Aqaba), Wu'ayra and Habees at Petra, and Taﬁleh. However, the Lordship of Oultre-
jourdain, as it came to be known, was far from impregnable, and inﬁltration across 
the River Jordan by a Muslim raiding party in 1139 seems to have persuaded 
Paganus the Butler, by then the effective ruler, to move his power base northwards 
from Shobak. Construction of the massive fortress at Karak began in 1142, and 
twenty years later, with the addition of another citadel at Ahamant (possibly Amman), 
Crusader-controlled territory in Transjordan extended from the River Zarqa to the Red 
Sea, and from the Jordan Valley to the desert.
Such power was short-lived, however. Between 1169 and 1174, the Karak 
headquarters underwent four sieges, managing to survive partly because the 
opposing Muslim armies were divided. By 1174, though, Salah ad-Din had united the 
Muslim forces and began methodically to oust the Crusaders from Transjordan. 
Karak withstood two more sieges during 1183, but the tide was turning: the Latin 
armies were much depleted, and their young king, Baldwin IV, was dying of leprosy. 
In 1187, at Hattin near Tiberias, they were roundly defeated by Salah ad-Din, who 
soon after took Jerusalem. Wu'ayra and the great prize, Karak itself, capitulated in 
late 1188, and Shobak - the last Transjordanian possession - fell in the spring of 
1189. The Europeans struggled on, but just a century later the entire Holy Land was 
once again under Arab rule.

exception. During a rebellion in 1879, Karaki Christians abandoned their 
town, moving north to settle among the ruins of ancient Madaba. In 1894, 
troops finally imposed order but Karak's ruling families - among them, the 
Majali clan - remained restless. In 1908 they rallied a local force and stormed 
Karak's government buildings, forcing the Ottoman garrison to seek refuge 
in the castle. After eight days, troops arrived from Damascus, publicly 
executed the rebel leaders and declared the Majalis outlaws. Even today 
Karak retains a reputation for political activism, yet - a little ironically, 
considering the family history - the Majalis are now at the heart of the 
Jordanian establishment, boasting government officials and even a prime 
minister or two among their number.
Arrival and accommodation
The King's Highway makes a poorly signposted zigzag around Karak; if you're 
driving it's easy to get confused. At a T-junction 12km south of Rabba, just by 
the Mujeb Hotel, turning left leads 34km west to Qatraneh on the Desert 
Highway (see p.317), while turning right brings you 4km through hilly suburbs 
to another T-junction at the foot of Karak castle. From here, turn left for the 
King's Highway to Tafileh, turn right to spiral up the hill into Karak. As you 
drive up, the only road through the walls into Karak town centre is a poorly 
marked turning on the left at the crest of the hill, just before an archway. If you 
miss it and start going down the back of the hill, make a U-turn: this road 
continues all the way down to the Dead Sea.
Buses from Amman (via the Desert Highway), Ma'an, Tafileh, Aqaba and 
elsewhere arrive at the bus station, at the foot of the hill by the King's 
Highway junction outside town. The only viable way to get to the castle from 
here is by taxi.
Karak stands halfway between Amman and Petra, and appears to make sense 
as an overnight stop, but in truth you'd do much better to press on to Dana: 
with one exception Karak's hotels are a disappointment.
There's a map of the King's Highway on p.220.

hotels, a clean, well-cared-for guesthouse 
converted from a family home: interiors are cosy, 
with armchairs, sofas, polished brass and an old 
gramophone, while guest rooms (all en suite) are 
decent and comfortable. They also have a 
spacious apartment, holding two double rooms, 
two bathrooms (with a jacuzzi), a lounge and a

It's fairly simple - don't expect boutique chic -

tired hotel that makes a living from serving lunches 
to passing tour groups: the dining room is pleasant 
and the welcome is warm, but stay overnight and 
you're paying for dirty rooms, greasy carpets, 
threadbare sheets, broken ﬁttings and a musty air 
of neglect. No public transport into town. 3-4

The Town
Everything you need in Karak is within a few minutes' stroll of the castle, at the 
highest point of town. Just in front of the castle is the Castle Plaza area, a 
tasteful complex of restored Ottoman buildings around a newly paved plaza 
beneath the castle walls, including the old al-Hammidi mosque and a Visitor
Centre (Sat-Thurs 8am-5pm, Fri 10am-4pm).
In sharp contrast is Karak's humdrum town centre. Venturing down any of the 
narrow streets that lead north from the castle - most of them lined with grand 
but grimy Ottoman-era balconied stone buildings - will bring you nose-to-
nose with Karak's bustling everyday shops and markets. The focus of town is an 
equestrian statue of Salah ad-Din, occupying a traffic junction about 400m 
north of the castle, around which spreads Karak's souk.
Karak castle
Occupying a rocky spur on the southern edge of the town centre, Karak
castle is first, and most impressively, visible on the approach from the east, its 
restored walls and glacis looming above the ravine below. Admission (Sat-
Thurs 8am-5pm, Fri 10am-4pm; JD1) is across a wooden footbridge 
spanning the moat from behind the Castle Plaza complex. The castle has seven 
separate levels, some buried deep inside the hill, and the best way to explore 
is to take a torch and simply let your inquisitiveness run free: it's quite 
possible to spend two or three atmospheric hours poking into dark rooms and 
gloomy vaulted passageways.
A good place to start is by heading up the slope once you enter, then doubling 
back on yourself into a long, vaulted passageway along the inside of the huge 
north wall built by the Crusaders. Down here, close to the original entrance of 
the castle in the northeastern corner, are a barracks and, on the right, the 
kitchens, complete with olive press and, further within, a huge oven. You 
emerge along the east wall, close to the ruined chapel. Over the battlements 
the restored glacis heralds a dizzy drop, and facing you is the partly complete 
Moving on from Karak
Buses for Amman's Wihdat station and Ma'an (via the Desert Highway), Taﬁleh (via 
the King's Highway) and Aqaba (via the Dead Sea/Wadi Araba road) only operate 
between 7am and about noon. You might be lucky and ﬁnd a bus after that time, but 
don't rely on it. To get to Dana, take a bus to Taﬁleh and another to Qadisiyyeh, or 
opt for a taxi (about JD30). Buses north along the King's Highway, terminating in 
Ariha on the rim of Wadi Mujib, leave from a side-street in the middle of town; to get 
to Madaba from Ariha, you'll have to hitch through the canyon to Dhiban (see p.239) 
and catch another bus there northwards. Buses to Mazra'a and Saﬁon the Dead 
Sea shore leave from a different street corner in town and go past Bab adh-Dhraa; 
those for Saﬁ also go past the turn-off for Lot's Cave.
From Karak to Petra
One bus may leave Karak around 3pm for Wadi Musa/Petra (JD5), but only via the 
Desert Highway. Otherwise catch a bus to Ma'an and change there for a minibus or 
serveece to Wadi Musa. If you want to follow the King's Highway to Petra, the slow 
way of getting there involves a minibus to Taﬁleh, another to Qadisiyyeh, hitching to 
Shobak and a minibus or serveece into Wadi Musa: it's likely to take all day. 
Otherwise, the quicker option by taxi (2hr 30min) costs JD50-60 for a full car (about 
double what it would be via the Desert Highway): ask your hotel or staff at the castle 
visitor centre to hunt down a driver, or just stop one on the street and ask.

Mamluke keep, the best-protected part of the castle. It's not difficult to climb 
to the highest point, from where there are scarily vertiginous views in all direc-
tions. In a sunken area between the chapel and the keep lie the remains of a 
Mamluke palace, while at the bottom of some steps just behind the chapel's 
apse is a beautifully carved stone panel. Of the two rooms opposite the panel, 
the one on the right features some reused Nabatean blocks set into the wall; 
next door, Reynald's extensive and suitably dank dungeons lead off into the 
hill. Back at the carved panel, a passageway to the left eventually brings you out, 
after passing another barracks, near the entrance. If you head down from here 
to the lower western side of the castle, you'll come across the museum, 
offering fascinating background to the history of the castle and the local area. 
Equally interesting is a restored Mamluke gallery nearby, running virtually the 
length of the west wall at the lowest level of the castle.
Eating and drinking
Karak's restaurants are pretty uninspiring. Opposite the castle are the touristy 
Kings and Fida, with mediocre kebab and chicken dishes, slightly bettered by the 
buffets served up at the Resthouse beside the castle. Just round the corner from the 
Fida, the Syrian-run Halabi is the height of friendliness and, although the simple 
fare is nothing to write home about, the cosy interior is an atmospheric place to 
sit and eat. The town centre has a host of ordinary Arabic eateries - but you'd do 
better to take a taxi 3km out of town to the lively, student-oriented suburb 
Al-Marj, where you'll find a clutch of good hummus and falafel restaurants, 
terrace cafés for smoking argileh and a hint of nightlife.
South of Karak
The King's Highway floats along the wheat-sown plateau south of Karak for 
10km to MUTA, best known today as the home of one of Jordan's leading 
universities, but also the scene, in 629 AD, of the first major battle between the 
Byzantine Empire and the nascent Muslim army on its first surge out of Arabia. 
On this occasion, the Muslims were routed, and its generals, including the 
Prophet Muhammad's adopted son Zaid bin Haritha and his deputy Jaafar bin 
Abi Talib, were killed. Some 3km south of Muta on the King's Highway, in the 
town of MAZAR, a large, royally funded mosque has been constructed over 
the shrines of Zaid and Jaafar.
South of Mazar, the landscape becomes increasingly wild. The major 
natural feature here is the immense Wadi Hasa, replete with hot springs at 
Hammamat Afra and an ancient Nabatean temple atop Jebel Tannur. Further 
south, past the attractive regional capital of Tafileh, the hills rise further, to 
the RSCN nature reserve at Dana and on to Shobak, site of a ruined 
Crusader castle.
Khirbet Tannur
A little way out of Mazar, two roads, old and new, descend past the cultivated 
fields of Ayna village into the vast Wadi Hasa, a natural boundary which 
marked the transition from Moab into the land of Edom. Dominating the 
There's a map of the King's Highway on p.220.

wadi is a huge and elementally scary black mountain - actually an extinct 
volcano - which clashes so startlingly with the white limestone all around 
that it seems to be under a permanent, ominous cloud. The Nabateans clearly 
felt something similar, since they built, on the conical hill of Jebel Tannur 
directly opposite, a large temple complex, Khirbet Tannur, ruined today but 
still visitable.
As you rise out of the wadi bed, a broken concrete sign on the right side of 
the highway, 24km from Mazar, marks the track leading to Khirbet Tannur. 
This is passable for a little way by car, but eventually you'll have to get out and 
make the tough climb across a saddle and up the steep slope to the atmospheric 
ruins. The temple area dates from the second century AD. Unfortunately, 
excavations in the 1930s carted off virtually everything of any interest, and all 
the carving and statuary that used to adorn the site now gathers dust in 
museums in Amman and Cincinnati. Yet, however hard it is to imagine the 
complete structures which once stood here, the windswept isolation of this 
rugged summit resurrects the presence of the Nabatean gods more potently 
even than Petra's quietest cranny.
You arrive on the summit more or less where the Nabatean worshippers 
would have arrived: in front is a humped threshold, originally part of the 
entrance gateway to a paved courtyard. It's easy to make out the wall founda-
tions of three rooms to the right, and although only random chunks of decora-
tive carving survive, many of the courtyard's flagstones are still in place. Ahead 
is a raised platform on which stood the small temple, its entrance originally 
crowned with a large carved image of the goddess Atargatis bedecked with vines 
and fruit (now on display in Amman). Within the holy of holies stood images 
both of Atargatis and the god Zeus-Hadad.
Hammamat Afra
Barely 2km from the Khirbet Tannur turning, the King's Highway is carried 
over Wadi Laban, a tributary of Wadi Hasa, on a small bridge; no buses follow 
the small turning off to the right side, but private transport can take you further 
along this narrow and winding side-road deep into the valley to reach a set of 
hot springs. Bear in mind that these are popular weekend getaways for local 
families: head out here on a Friday and you're unlikely to be alone.
A turn-off after 7km leads down to Hammamat Burbita, in a broad and 
sunny part of the valley, with the river fringed by reed-beds and some cultiva-
tion - but the only access to the thermal springs here is within a rather grim, 
graffitied concrete complex. You'd do better to head back up and continue 
along the road.
After 5km of narrow switchbacks, high above the valley floor, you reach a gate 
across the road giving access to HAMMAMAT AFRA (open 24hr; JD5). 
There are some leisure facilities here, but this is not a tourist spa: the atmosphere 
is unequivocally Jordanian. The hot pools (four outdoor ones for men, one 
indoors for women) are set down in a gorge between high, narrow cliffs that 
cut out most of the direct sunshine, and are generally well maintained. The 
water is a striking rust-red colour from the high iron content, and genuinely 
hot: the last pool on the left - popularly known as the megla, or frying pan - is 
a broiling 52°C. The walls all along the narrow valley drip water, with mineral 
reds and mossy greens daubing the white limestone. Splashing barefoot up or 
down the warm river here is as much pleasure as flopping around in the pools 
with everybody else. A couple of kiosks sell snacks and cold drinks, but most 
people set up barbecues on the various terraces around the site. Simple chalets
(2) offer basic overnight accommodation.
THE KING'S HIGHWAY | South of Karak

249
Taﬁleh
South of Wadi Hasa, the King's Highway begins to climb into the Shara 
mountains, eventually reaching a small plateau where a road branches east (left) 
to the Desert Highway (if you're heading north along the King's Highway, the 
signposting at this junction is confusing and it's easy to lose the way). It was near 
here that, in January 1918, the only fully fledged battle of the Arab Revolt took 
place, Faysal and Lawrence's armies sweeping away an Ottoman force only to 
be halted in their tracks by heavy snow.
Some 25km south of the turn-off for Hammamat Afra, the picturesque town 
of TAFILEH comes into view, spread along gently curving terraces, with 
orchards of fruit and olives blanketing the hillside below. Although a governo-
rate capital and a sizeable town, Tafileh has no specific attractions to make for 
(the signposted "castle" in the middle of town comprises a single, inaccessible 
tower, most likely Mamluke), and you'll probably find yourself stopping only to 
switch buses. However, note that buses stop running by about midday: if you 
arrive in the afternoon you'll find no buses to Dana, Petra or Amman - and so 
your only option will be to negotiate with the local taxi-drivers.
About 4km south of Tafileh is a turn-off westwards, signed for Aqaba and Fifa. 
This is the last surfaced road connecting the King's Highway and Wadi Araba 
until you reach Aqaba. It offers truly spectacular views out over the desert as it 
coils down to Fifa (see p.137), just south of the Dead Sea.
Sela
In the rugged hills south of Tafileh looms the remote mountain fastness of 
SELA, which offers a taxing but memorable hike up to a summit with magnifi-
cent views. The village of Ain al-Baydha, about 10km south of Tafileh, marks 
a turn-off heading steeply down the cliffside to the picturesque hamlet of 
As-Sil, with old stone cottages - not unlike Dana (see p.250) - clustering 
higgledy-piggledy on an outcrop. The giant sandstone mountain of Sela looms 
opposite the hamlet, on the other side of a deep ravine; As-Sil is just about 
accessible by ordinary car, but to go on you'll have to resort to 4x4 or your own 
leg-muscles. A guide is essential, since this is barren and inhospitable terrain. 
Either start out early in the day, and ask around for help in Ain al-Baydha village, 
or consult the RSCN staff at Dana in advance.
A biblical account in II Kings narrates the story of the seventh-century BC 
King Amaziah of Judah, who attacked Edom, defeated a ten-thousand-strong 
army and seized "Selah", while II Chronicles says that, during the same 
campaign, Amaziah threw ten thousand captive Edomites off the "rock". Some 
archeologists have related present-day Sela with these events (the Hebrew word 
for "rock" is sela), but others have suggested that these events took place at the 
similarly remote, inaccessible mountain Umm al-Biyara at Petra - partly since 
the Greek word petra also means "rock". Neither case has been conclusively 
proved, and even the discovery of a worn inscription in Babylonian cuneiform, 
carved in a smoothed rectangle in the cliff-face on the side of the mountain of 
Sela (and just about visible to the naked eye from As-Sil), hasn't provided any 
further insight. The one-hour hike up to the summit from As-Sil heads down 
into the valley, then up via a Nabatean-style rock-cut stairway; once at the top, 
aside from exploring the various cisterns and chambers, you're rewarded with 
outstanding views over the rocky domes and towers of this folded landscape.
At the end of the road leading down through Ain al-Baydha into As-Sil is an 
open car park on a terrace viewpoint, alongside a restored complex of stone 
cottages converted into a café and restaurant. Locals drive out here from Tafileh

and the nearby villages for open-air sunset parties - especially on a Thursday 
and Friday - to play music, smoke argileh and generally hang out. Join them if 
you fancy.
Dana Nature Reserve
In Qadisiyyeh, a small town (population 18,000) located 27km south of Tafileh 
and 24km north of Shobak, a steep road winds down off the King's Highway 
to Dana. This hamlet (population 40) lies at the eastern edge of Jordan's flagship 
DANA NATURE RESERVE (Wwww.rscn.org.jo), which encompasses 320 
square kilometres of terrain around the breathtaking Wadi Dana, stretching as 
far as Wadi Araba in the west. The village has been the scene of an extraordinary 
- and successful - social experiment conducted by the RSCN to rejuvenate a 
dying community by protecting the natural environment. Clinging to the edge 
of the cliff below the King's Highway, Dana is the starting point for a series of 
walks and hikes through one of Jordan's loveliest protected areas. Whether you 
stay for an hour or a week, you won't want to leave.
The reserve's terrain drops from 1500m above sea level at Dana to below sea 
level west of Feynan, and its geology switches from limestone to sandstone to 
granite, ecosystems varying from lush, well-watered mountain slopes and open 
oak and juniper woodlands to scrubland and arid sandy desert. The list of flora
and resident fauna is dizzying: a brief roundup includes various kinds of eagles, 
falcons, kestrels and vultures, cuckoos, owls, the Sinai rosefinch and Tristram's 
serin; wildcats, caracals, hyenas, jackals, badgers, foxes, wolves, hares, bats, 
hedgehogs, porcupine and ibex; snakes, chameleons and lizards galore; fresh-
water crabs; and, so far, three plants new to science out of more than seven 
hundred plant species recorded.
Arrival
By the most direct driving route, Dana lies 202km south of Amman (7th 
Circle). Head due south on the Desert Highway to Husseiniyya, then turn west 
(27km) to the large Rashdiyyeh cement factory, from where Qadisiyyeh is 3km 
to the left (south). The turn-off down the cliffside into Dana is marked with a 
small brown sign at the top end of Qadisiyyeh village.
As you approach from the north you'll see several signs to the Dana Nature 
Reserve pointing off into the countryside: though they don't say so, these are 
indicating an access route into the northern fringe of the reserve around the 
Rummana campsite. If you want Dana village, stay on the road until you reach 
the cement factory, then go 3km further to the turn-off in Qadisiyyeh.
Dana also lies 53km north of Petra (Wadi Musa). Follow the main road 
through Shobak town, then pick up signs to Tafileh: ignore roads to the right 
signed Amman (they join the Desert Highway at Unayza). Keep going straight 
into Qadisiyyeh, then drive all the way up the long main street to find the turn-
off (left) to Dana at the top of the village.
The only bus into Dana shuttles regularly to and from Qadisiyyeh on the 
King's Highway above the village. Qadisiyyeh has regular bus links from Tafileh 
- as well as one or two from Amman (Wihdat station) - but the section of the 
King's Highway to the south, between Qadisiyyeh and Shobak, has very little 
public transport. Hitching is one option, or bargain hard for a taxi: a full car to 
Dana from Shobak or Tafileh should cost about JD15-20, or from Wadi Musa 
about JD30-35.
THE KING'S HIGHWAY | Dana Nature Reserve

251
On the way down into Dana, a viewpoint gives a tremendous panorama of Wadi 
Dana and the roofs of the old stone cottages below. Further down, as you clatter 
down the steep cobbled street into the village centre, you come to a fork: go 
straight on to the small hotels in the village, turn left to the RSCN Guesthouse.
The story of Dana
Dana is unique, not only in Jordan but in the whole Middle East - a positive, visionary 
programme combining scientiﬁc research, social reconstruction and sustainable
tourism. For most of the twentieth century Dana was a simple farming community 
thriving on a temperate climate, three abundant springs and good grazing; indeed, 
some inhabitants had previously left Taﬁleh speciﬁcally for a better life in the village. 
But as Jordan developed new technologies and the general standard of living rose, 
a growing number of villagers felt isolated in their mountain hamlet of Ottoman stone 
cottages. Some moved out in the late 1960s to establish a new village, Qadisiyyeh,
on the main Taﬁleh-Shobak road, and the attractions of electricity and plumbing 
rapidly emptied primitive Dana. The construction of the huge Rashdiyyeh cement 
factory close by in the early 1980s was the last straw: with well-paid jobs for the 
taking, most locals saw the daily trek up from Dana to the factory as pointless, and 
almost everyone moved to Qadisiyyeh.
Dana lay semi-abandoned for a decade or more, its handful of impoverished farmers 
forced to compete in the local markets with bigger farms using more advanced 
methods of production. This was what a group of twelve women from Amman discov-
ered in the early 1990s as they travelled across the country to catalogue the remnants 
of traditional Jordanian culture. Realizing the deprivation faced by some of the poorest 
people in the country, these "Friends of Dana" embarked on a project to renovate 
and revitalize the fabric of the village under the auspices of the Royal Society for the 
Conservation of Nature. Electricity, telephones and a water supply were extended to 
the village and 65 cottages renovated. People started to drift back to Dana. The RSCN 
quickly realized the potential of the secluded Wadi Dana for scientiﬁc research; in a 
project funded partly by the World Bank and the UN, they turned the area into a 
protected nature reserve, built a small research station next to the village and, in 
1994, launched a detailed ecological survey.
Continued grazing by thousands of domesticated goats, sheep and camels 
couldn't be reconciled with the need for environmental protection and so was 
banned; studies were undertaken into creating sustainable opportunities for villagers 
to gain a livelihood from the reserve. The ingenious solution came in redirecting the 
village's traditional crops to a new market. Dana's farmers produced their olives, ﬁgs, 
grapes, other fruits and nuts as before, but instead they sold everything to the RSCN, 
who employed the villagers to process these crops into novelty products such as 
organically produced jams and olive-oil soap for direct sale to relatively wealthy, 
environmentally aware consumers, both Jordanian and foreign. Medicinal herbs were 
introduced as a cash crop to aid the economic recovery, and the last Dana resident 
familiar with traditional pottery-making was encouraged to teach her craft to a 
younger generation. Dana soon hit the headlines, and in 1996 the RSCN launched 
low-impact tourism to the reserve, with the traditional-style Guesthouse going up 
next to the research buildings. Local villagers - some of whom were already 
employed as research scientists - were taken on as managers and guides. "Green 
tourism" awards followed, and, with Dana becoming better known as a tourist desti-
nation, locals opened a couple of small, budget hotels within the village. A campsite 
was established in the hills at Rummana, and in 2005 the RSCN opened a new 
"wilderness lodge" at the lower, western end of the reserve at Feynan - both of them 
built and staffed by local people. In only one generation, moribund Dana has been 
given a new lease of life.

Accommodation and eating
Dana's accommodation - whether in a building or under canvas - isn't cheap 
but, considering what's been achieved in the village, the wonderful atmosphere 
and the great walking on offer, is worth the extra and more. The lack of shops 
or restaurants means that, for eating, you must either take all meals at your hotel 
or campsite, or bring in supplies for picnics and self-catering; a mix of the two 
is in many ways the best solution.
RSCN Dana Guesthouse
For its cosy atmosphere, simple comforts and an incredible silence, a night at the 
small RSCN-run A Guesthouse (T03 227 0497, Etourism@rscn.org.jo; 6-7)
is likely to be one of your most memorable in Jordan. Stay here a few days and 
let the atmosphere seep into your bones: there's nowhere else like it in the 
country. It's worth every penny.
The building and its furniture were designed by architect Ammar Khammash 
(Wwww.khammash.com) in a skilful and attractive blend of traditional 
Jordanian styles and a chic minimalism in stone and iron. By the time you read 
this, a planned extension may already be open; the original building, though, 
holds just nine rooms. All of them, and the main terrace, overlook the full 
length of the still Wadi Dana: at night, lights twinkling on the Dead Sea and 
the call of nightjars echoing eerily up the valley make for an unforgettably

THE KING'S HIGHWAY | Dana Nature Reserve
Prices at Jordan's RSCN-run nature reserves are high. The RSCN makes no 
apologies for this: it says that the reason it exists is to protect Jordan's natural 
environment, and that it has built lodges and developed tourism as a tool for gener-
ating funds to help conservation and support rural communities. You may or may 
not agree with their pricing policy - but this kind of responsible tourism is virtually 
unknown in the Middle East, and the RSCN are pioneers. For now, until tourism 
schemes emerge that are truly community-owned, paying extra to visit the RSCN 
reserves is a good way to ensure that your money goes to beneﬁt rural people 
and habitats.

serene experience. Queen Noor, wife of the late King Hussein, famously called 
the views "ten-star", and it's hard to argue with her. 
The rooms - doubles, triples and one quad - are kept spotlessly clean by the 
cheerful and amenable staff, and all bar one have a private balcony perched 
over the valley. You can pay more to have the only room with an en-suite 
bathroom (all the rest share bathrooms), but should always book weeks in 
advance, either direct or with the RSCN's "Wild Jordan" tourism unit in 
Amman (see p.51).
Room rates include a good breakfast. With advance notice, staff can prepare 
lunches and dinners (JD6-15), as well as hikers' lunchboxes: if you're staying the 
night, make sure to book dinner.
Alongside the Guesthouse is a nature shop (daily 8am-4pm) selling local 
products such as herbs, fruit and jewellery, as well as textiles, gifts and other 
handmade items from RSCN projects around the country. Beside it is a kids' 
learning zone, where displays give a sense of Dana's natural context.
Other hotels in Dana village
A couple of small hotels in Dana village offer a budget option. The A Dana
Hotel (T03 227 0537 or 079 559 7307, Esuleimanjarad@yahoo.com, Wwww
.danavillage.piczo.com; 1), in the village centre on the left, is part of the "Sons 
of Dana and Qadisiyyeh Tourism Co-operative": profits go to support local 
low-income families (notably putting students through university). The hotel 
occupies one of the old stone cottages, sympathetically renovated. It's a great, 
atmospheric little place, with simple rooms ranged around a quiet stone-flagged 
courtyard, plus more rooms in an annexe across the street. There's a choice of 
en-suite or shared bathrooms, plus the option of sleeping in the tent on the roof. 
Breakfast is included; other meals cost JD5.
Further on, at the back of the village, rises the Dana Tower Hotel (T03 227 
0226 or 079 568 8853, Edana_tower2@hotmail.com; 1). Occupying four of 
the old cottages, this is a slightly less sympathetic restoration: if you like 
backpacker graffiti on the walls, flags of the world, the aroma of joss sticks and

trinkets dotted about, this place is for you. The owners have dissociated 
themselves both from the RSCN and the village co-operative, so despite its 
hippyish appearance, this is a purely profit-making business. Rooms are decent 
and clean, and include breakfast (other meals are JD5). Transport to or from 
Qadisiyyeh and Petra is discounted.
RSCN Rummana campsite
The great Dana outdoors is best experienced by camping, but in order for the 
RSCN to control numbers within the reserve you're not allowed to pitch your 
own tent. Instead, aim for the A Rummana campsite (March-Oct; 
Etourism@rscn.org.jo; 4-5), in the hills to the north of Wadi Dana. To stay, 
you must book in advance through the Dana Guesthouse, letting them know 
when and how you intend to arrive, whether you want meals cooked, and so 
on. There are twenty tents, all of them solid and roomy and capable of sleeping 
four or more: rates are about JD24pp for double or triple, plus JD12pp above 
that. Prices include a mattress, pillows, blankets, a towel and access to a proper, 
clean toilet block with cold showers. Staff can prepare meals on request 
(JD6-15).
To get to Rummana from Dana, the walk is an easy couple of hours around 
the head of the valley, or you can request a free transfer from the Guesthouse. 
Driving south down the King's Highway, the Rummana turning is before 
Dana: turn right 22km south of Tafileh, just before the main road cuts through 
a small wood, at a blue sign for "Ain Lahda" and a small brown sign for the 
campsite. Driving north from Dana village, at the top of the access road turn 
left (up the hill) on the main Qadisiyyeh-Tafileh road, and follow this for 
about 5km; just beyond where the road cuts straight through the middle of a 
small wood, turn left at the same brown sign for the campsite. This brings you 
down below the level of the main road onto a wide, bumpy gravel road used 
by trucks; carry on, past a huge quarry on the left, and then down a signposted 
left turn. About 1km further you'll come to the "Tower" - a small building 
with an office and a lookout terrace - where you must park. This marks the 
entrance to the reserve.
From copper to leather
In antiquity, Feynan was a major industrial area for smelting copper. As early as ﬁve 
thousand years ago, simple wind-ﬁred kilns were being used to extract copper for 
ornaments and tools. Mining and smelting techniques progressed through the 
Bronze and Iron Ages, reaching a peak under the Romans, when Feynan hosted the 
largest copper mines in the empire. Wealth-generation continued into the Byzantine 
era - from when many of the extant ruins at Feynan date - and archeological investi-
gations to discover more about the site remain ongoing.
Today, too, Feynan is thriving: the local Azazmeh bedouin are participating in an 
RSCN scheme that is altering the rural economy to place greater emphasis on 
environmental protection. For years, their goats have been overgrazing reserve land 
and decimating the local ﬂora, but rather than banning them - which would merely 
foment ill-will and shift the problem elsewhere - the RSCN is attempting instead to 
invest in them, fattening the goats in large pens outside reserve land and training 
local women to produce new craft items from goat leather; both projects mean that 
the goats sell for higher prices at market and that their owners can additionally raise 
the value of each animal by selling the hide. You can ask to visit the leather 
workshops at Feynan to see more. Crafts made from Feynan goat leather are on sale 
at RSCN nature shops around Jordan.
THE KING'S HIGHWAY | Dana Nature Reserve

Check in at the Tower, and staff will radio ahead to summon the shuttle bus 
(actually a small truck), which will take you down the hill to the campsite, 
which is located in an idyllic spot at the foot of Jebel Rummana. The shuttle to 
and from the Tower (and, on request, back to the Dana Guesthouse) is free.
RSCN Feynan Lodge
Down at the lower, western end of the reserve at Feynan stands the RSCN's 
A Feynan Lodge (Sept-June; Etourism@rscn.org.jo; 7). To stay, you must 
book in advance through the Dana Guesthouse, letting them know when and 
how you intend to arrive, whether you want meals cooked, and so on.
Feynan is a desert area, quite unlike Dana - down here it's hot, dry and dusty, 
and the solar-powered, environmentally friendly lodge (designed, again, by 
Ammar Khammash) is both a base for active exploration of the surrounding area 
and an isolated retreat for those seeking solitude. It has electricity, but all 26 rooms 
- designed in an attractive, spartan style (with en-suite bathrooms) and laid out 
on two levels around an internal courtyard - are lit only by candles set into 
mirrored niches. The walls are thick, and windows are either small or shielded 
from full sun, making the interior cool and pleasant in even the hottest weather. 
There's an attractive communal sitting and eating area, with a traditional oven for 
staff to prepare meals on request (JD6-15), including vegetarian dishes from local 
ingredients. The atmosphere of the place is bewitchingly calm, peaceful and 
contemplative - especially at night, under clear skies amid flickering candlelight.
There is no access to the lodge by paved road: the only way to get here is on 
foot from Dana (a five-hour walk) or with a 4x4 from the nearest villages to 
the west, Qurayqira (pronounced "graygra") or its neighbour Rashaydeh: for 
more info, see p.356. From a turn-off (signposted Feynan) on the Wadi Araba 
road about 135km north of Aqaba or 40km south of Fifa, a road runs for 17km 
to Qurayqira and another 5km on to Rashaydeh, where the tarmac ends. From 
either village, you can ask around for a 4x4 ride on the 10km of desert track to 
the lodge itself, or arrange a lift in advance through the RSCN.
Walks in and around the Dana reserve
Once you arrive in Dana, it's worth stopping in at the RSCN-run Guesthouse
- whether you're staying there or not - both for the views from their terrace 
(binoculars are available if you'd like to do a spot of birdwatching) and to get 
some firsthand information about the reserve's wildlife from the experts. They 
have leaflets detailing a number of walks and activities, and can provide a trained 
nature guide for any of the walks at a fixed rate: JD15 for 1-2hr, JD25 for 
3-4hr, JD35 for 5-6hr, or JD85 for full-day trails (including down to Feynan). 
Many of the walks require you to take a guide, but there's a handful of routes 
on which you can strike out alone: the website Wwww.rscn.org.jo lists them 
all. All these walks and others in the area are described in Jordan: Walks, Treks, 
Caves, Climbs & Canyons by Tony Howard: p.404 has details of this and also of 
some excellent field guides to local flora and fauna.
Admission to the reserve for any of the walks costs JD7, but this fee is waived 
if you stay overnight at RSCN accommodation in Dana, Rummana or Feynan. 
Otherwise, if you stay at one of the budget hotels in Dana village, or if you 
arrive for the day and choose to tackle a self-guided trail without hiring an 
RSCN nature guide, then you must pay.
Walks from Dana village
The most obvious walking route in the reserve is the magnificent Wadi Dana 
Trail (14km; 5-6hr) from the village along the downward-sloping floor of the 
THE KING'S HIGHWAY | Dana Nature Reserve

256
wadi, an easy walk passing from the lush green gardens of Dana through increas-
ingly wild and desolate terrain to Feynan. This can be done alone or with a 
guide - as can the easy Village Tour (2km; 2hr), a stroll around Dana to enjoy 
the views and visit the workshops where local women make silver jewellery and 
prepare dried fruit.
All other trails can be done only with a guide. The White Dome Trail (8km; 
3hr; March-Oct only) is a beautiful walk that follows a contour around the 
head of the valley, passing first through the spring-fed terraced gardens of Dana 
and then beneath the massive escarpment to Rummana.
Another highly explorable area is Al-Barra, a fifteen-minute drive south of the 
village, where lush woodlands give way to networks of canyons and gorges cutting 
into the mountainous landscape. This is the starting point for the superb Feathers 
Canyon Trail (3km; 3hr) to Shaq ar-Reesh ("Canyon of the Feathers"), a 
Nabatean mountain retreat. The walk begins in flower-filled meadows and quiet 
terraces, but involves a bit of scrambling and climbing through a narrow gorge to 
reach the spectacular summit, dotted with cisterns and water-channels. Al-Barra 
is also the start and finish for the Nawatef Trail (2km; 2hr), heading out to the 
springs and ruins at Nawatef and back on a different route. The beautiful but 
difficult Wadi Dathneh Trail (16km; 8hr) also starts from Al-Barra, passing 
between the red cliffs of Wadi Hamra before reaching the verdant oasis of 
Hammam Adethni and following flowing water all the way down to Feynan.
Walks from Rummana campsite
All walks from Rummana operate only when the campsite is open (roughly 
March-Oct). Highly recommended is the White Dome Trail (8km; 3hr; guide 
compulsory) to Dana, outlined above, or the alternative Dana Village Trail
(5km; 4hr; guide compulsory), following a rougher track.
All other trails can be walked without a guide. The easy Campsite Trail (2km; 
1hr) leads on a circular route around the Rummana area, offering stunning views 
The Dana-Petra trek
One of the Middle East's most impressive long-distance treks - recently dubbed 
"Jordan's Inca Trail" - links Dana village and Feynan with Petra (45km; 3-5 days; 
guide compulsory). The general direction heads far off any beaten tracks, from Dana 
to Feynan, across open country towards Shobak, and then to "Little Petra" in order 
to arrive at Petra via a back route over the mountains. It's a challenging, but extraor-
dinarily rewarding, walk.
However, it is not waymarked - and, in fact, there is no single accepted path. Many of 
the specialist independent guides listed on p.50 can lead you from Dana to Petra, but 
they won't necessarily all go the same way (and some paths are more beautiful than 
others). Some propose two nights camping out between Feynan and Little Petra; others 
say three. A handful of tour operators in the UK and elsewhere offer the route as part of 
a Jordan package, but if you'd like to tackle it independently, talk to RSCN staff at the 
Dana Guesthouse (or at the "Wild Jordan" centre in Amman), for an idea of the logistics 
- and then compare with some of the independent specialists: particularly recommend-
able for the Dana-Petra route is Yamaan Safady. One key point is to determine what 
facilities are on offer at each overnight stop: some guides will carry everything with 
them, others will bring in trail support so that tea and meals are ready when you arrive.
The walk itself is epic, covering a range of terrain from highland forests to wild, 
rolling hills and scorching deserts, dropping down to the ﬂoor of the Wadi Araba, then 
climbing again into the sandstone mountains. There's little point trying to compress 
it into words: if you're a wilderness fan, this one's for you.
THE KING'S HIGHWAY | Dana Nature Reserve

257
and birdwatching lookouts. The moderate Rummana Trail (2.5km; 2hr) follows 
a trail through the juniper trees up to the summit of Jebel Rummana ("Pomegranate 
Mountain") for the views down into Wadi Araba: it's also easy to spot raptors up 
here, and if you head up at dawn you may see ibex. Across from the campsite is the 
Cave Trail (1km; 1.5hr), a short, rough walk leading to a set of caves above Shaq 
al-Kalb ("Dog Canyon"), residence of hyenas, wildcats and wolves.
A short walk from the campsite is a bird hide overlooking a small pool - ideal 
for early morning observation of birds and ibex - and should you fancy 
stretching your legs instead of sitting on the shuttle bus, the walk back up to the 
Tower from the campsite takes about an hour.
Walks from Feynan Lodge
All walks from Feynan operate only when the lodge is open (Sept-June) and all 
require a guide. The Feynan Copper Mine Trail (3km; 2hr) is a circular walk 
around the area's antiquities, including Bronze and Iron Age copper mines, 
remains of Byzantine churches, a Roman tower and more. An alternative is the 
easy Wadi Ghwair Trail (8km; 3-4hr) which follows the gravel bed of the Wadi 
Feynan to the confluence with the Ghwair canyon. It's also possible to tackle the 
Feynan Trail (14km; 6hr) - the long hike from Feynan all the way up the valley 
floor, passing from stony desert up to the forested highlands of Dana.
Feynan also hosts some eco-friendly mountain-bike trails of 2km, 4km and 
8km, circling around the lodge and the nearby archeological ruins. Bike rental 
costs JD10/JD20 per person for a half/full day - and if you'd like a guide to 
accompany you, there's an extra fee of JD23/JD85.
Shobak castle
Perched dramatically like a ship on the crest of a hill, Shobak castle was the 
first to be built by the Crusaders in Transjordan (see p.244 for some Crusader 
history). In a more ruinous state than Karak castle, and much rebuilt by 
Mamlukes and Ottomans, it's nonetheless well worth an exploratory detour.
As they are today, the walls and towers are Mamluke, and all the towers 
which stand have beautifully carved external calligraphic inscriptions dating 
from rebuilding work in the 1290s. As you enter, down and to the left is a small 
chapel, at the back of which are pools and channels of unknown usage. Below 
the chapel runs a long, dank and pitch-dark secret passage, which brings you 
out in the middle of the castle if you head right, and outside the walls if you 
head left. Back alongside the chapel is the original gatehouse, to the left side 
of which are two round wells which presage an even scarier secret passage - a 
dark and foul opening with, according to legend, 375 broken and slippery steps 
leading down into the heart of the hill. Even archeologists only got to number 
150 or so before giving up, but this was the castle's main water supply: somehow 
the Crusaders knew that by digging down so far they'd eventually hit water. A 
prudent "No Entry" sign now bars entry: tourists who have ignored this and 
started down this staircase anyway (including a potholing expert who tried it in 
2008) have ended up seriously injuring themselves, describing how the stairs 
crumbled away under their feet. The gatehouse gives onto a street, at the end of 
which is a building with three arched entrances, one topped by a calligraphic 
panel; up until the 1950s the castle was still inhabited, and this building was the

old village school. If you head through to the back and turn right, a long vaulted 
corridor leads you out to the north side of the castle, and a maze of abandoned 
Ottoman cottages, beneath which is an exposed Ayyubid palace complex, 
with a large reception hall and baths. Further round towards the entrance stand 
the beautiful arches of a church, beneath which is a small room filled with 
catapult balls and chunks of carved masonry.
Practicalities
The castle lies 3km west of SHOBAK town, which is 24km south of Qadisi-
yyeh and 27km north of Wadi Musa. Buses and some serveeces run to Shobak 
direct from Amman's Wihdat station (mornings only) and from Wadi Musa (all 
day), but there is virtually no public transport from Qadisiyyeh. No buses run 
up to the castle, so without your own transport you'll need to persuade a taxi-
driver to take you or face a stiff climb. A small, simple campsite is signposted 
from the castle and the village.
Set in acres of lush orchards, Shobak is Jordan's leading producer of apples, but 
this quiet farming village has also been trying for years to reap some benefit 
from the tourists heading south to Petra. Aside from some good local restau-
rants on the main drag, its numerous groceries beat those in Wadi Musa on 
both price and quality: if you intend to picnic in Petra, you'd do well to stock 
up here in advance.

Petra  
P
etra is incredible. Tucked away in a remote valley basin in the heart of 
southern Jordan's Shara mountains and shielded from the outside world 
behind an impenetrable barrier of rock, this fabled ancient city of 
ornate classical facades is wreathed in a sense of mystery and drama. 
Since a Western adventurer stumbled on the site in 1812, it has fired imagina-
tions, its grandeur and dramatic setting pushing it - like the Pyramids or the 
Taj Mahal - into the realms of legend. Today, it's almost as if time has literally 
drawn a veil over the once-great city, which grew wealthy enough on the 
caravan trade to challenge the might of Rome: two millennia of wind and rain 
have blurred the sharp edges of the facades and rubbed away at the soft 
sandstone to expose vivid bands of colour beneath, putting the whole scene 
into soft focus.
Where Petra sits, in a valley basin between two lines of jagged peaks, there's 
only one route in and out, and that passes through the modern town of Wadi 
Musa, on the eastern side of the mountains. In the last few decades this town 
has grown to serve the lucrative tourist trade to Petra, and has all the hotels, 
restaurants and services you'd expect: there's nowhere to stay within the ancient 
city itself, and virtually nowhere to eat either. The single entrance gate into 
Petra is in Wadi Musa, but once you've crossed the barrier you're immediately 
thrown into the rocky landscape of the desert. There is no urban development 
of any kind within Petra, and the local culture is all rural. Spending a few days 
here is a constant to-and-fro - down-at-heel Wadi Musa providing all the 
necessities of life, and majestic Petra all the historical and natural drama.
Some history
In prehistory, the Petra region saw some of the first experiments in farming. The 
hunter-gatherers of the Paleolithic Age gave way, over nine thousand years 
Weather conditions
Petra is situated in the mountains, at around 1100m above sea level. In spring
(March-May) and autumn (Sept-Oct) it is pleasantly warm, with highs around 25-
30°C and virtually no chance of rain. In summer (late May to early Sept) it can be 
blisteringly hot during the day, perhaps above 40°C. However, with the altitude and 
the desert conditions, nights year-round are cool. In winter (Nov-Feb), Petra can be 
cold, often not getting above 10-15°C during the day and dropping below freezing at 
night: rain is to be expected, and snow is not uncommon.

PETRA |

ago, to settled communities living in walled farming villages such as at Baydha, 
just north of Petra. Nomadic tribes passed through the Petra basin in the 
millennia following, but the spur to its development came with attempts at 
contact between the two great ancient powers of Mesopotamia and Egypt. 
The desert plateaux of Mesopotamia, to the east of the King's Highway, were 
sealed off by high mountains from the routes both across the Naqab (Negev) to 
Gaza and across the Sinai to Egypt; somehow a caravan route across the barrier 
had to be found if contact was to be made. Petra, where abundant springs 
tumble down into the Wadi Araba through a natural fault in the mountains, was 
prime choice, marking the spot on the north-south King's Highway where an 
east-west passage could connect the two empires.
The first significant mention of Petra is in the Old Testament, as the Israel-
ites approached Edom after their forty years in the desert. Local 
legend - running against the geographical evidence - maintains that it was in 
the hills just above Petra that God ordered Moses to produce water for the 
Israelites by speaking to a rock. Moses instead struck the rock, and the spring 
that gushed is today named Ain Musa (Spring of Moses), its outflow housed 
beneath a small domed building at the eastern entrance to the town of Wadi 
Musa. King Reqem of Edom (Reqem was the Semitic name for Petra, and 
he was probably just a local chieftain) refused permission to the Israelites to 
pass through his territory, but before they departed, Moses' brother Aaron

(Haroun in Arabic) died, and was buried supposedly on top of Jebel Haroun
overlooking Petra. A white shrine atop the mountain is still a site of pilgrimage 
for Jews, Christians and Muslims alike.
Just after 1000 BC, the Israelite King David moved to take control of Petra 
and the whole of Edom - by now rich on the proceeds of copper production 
as well as trade. His son Solomon consolidated the Israelite grip on trade and 
technology, and for fifty years diverted Petra's profits into his own coffers. 
However, after his death, the Israelite kingdom collapsed and feuding erupted. 
Some Edomites withdrew to a settlement on top of the impregnable Umm
al-Biyara mountain overlooking central Petra and to a village at Tawilan
above Ain Musa. Fluctuations in regional power soon after led to Petra passing 
from Edomite hands to Assyrian to Babylonian to Persian: such instability 
left the way open for a new people to stamp their authority on the land and 
stake a claim to its future.
The Nabateans
The first mention of the Nabateans was in 647 BC, when they were listed as 
one of the enemies of Ashurbanipal, last king of Assyria; at that stage, they were 
still a tribe of bedouin nomads inhabiting northern and northwestern Arabia. 
When the Babylonians depopulated much of Palestine during the sixth 
century BC, many Edomites came down from Petra to claim the empty land 
to the west. In turn, the Nabateans migrated out of the arid Arabian desert to 
the lusher and more temperate mountains of Edom, and, specifically, to the 
well-watered and easily defended prize of Petra. Whereas the Edomites had 
occupied the hills above Petra, the Nabateans quickly saw the potential for 
developing the central bowl of the valley floor. The migrants arrived slowly, 
though, and for several centuries it seems that most stuck to their bedouin 
lifestyle, building little other than a temple and refuge atop Umm al-Biyara. 
However, displaying the adaptability that was to become their trademark, the 
Nabateans soon gave up the traditional occupation of raiding the plentiful 
caravans that passed to and fro in favour of charging the merchants for safe 
passage and a place to do business. It was probably around this time that the 
first organized, permanent trading emporium was established at Petra, and 
Edom became known as Arabia Petrea.
The Roman author Diodorus Siculus reports that the Greek Seleucid ruler 
of Syria, Antigonus, attacked Petra in 312 BC, both to limit Nabatean power 
and to undermine Ptolemaic authority. His troops sneaked in under cover of 
darkness, and found that all the Nabatean men were away. The Greeks slaugh-
tered a few women and children and hurriedly made off with as much booty 
as they could carry - silver, myrrh and frankincense. However, someone 
managed to raise the alarm, since within an hour, the Nabateans were in 
pursuit. They rapidly caught up with the complacent army, massacred all but 
fifty, recovered the valuables and returned home. In true merchant style, 
though, the Nabateans instinctively recognized that war would do no good to 
their flourishing business, and so sent a mollifying letter of explanation to 
Antigonus. The general pretended to accept, but was secretly fuming; he let 
some time pass before sending another army against Petra. The small garrison 
they encountered, however, easily repelled the attackers. Comfortably ensconced 
in their unassailable headquarters, the Nabateans acted the wealthy tycoon: 
unruffled by the skirmish, they reached into their deep pockets to buy peace 
from the humiliated Greeks.
Over the following two centuries, the battling between Seleucid Syria and 
Ptolemaic Egypt for control of Alexander's empire enabled the Nabateans to fill

"Sheikh Ibrahim" Burckhardt
Jean Louis Burckhardt was born in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1784. He travelled to 
London when he was 22 and shortly after came under the wing of the Association for 
Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts of Africa, which offered him the mission 
of locating the source of the River Niger. Burckhardt accepted. Then, as now, Egypt 
was the gateway into Africa, and so he devised a plan to familiarize himself with Islam 
and Arab culture in preparation for the expedition. Journeys into the Middle East at 
this time were extremely dangerous: the territory was virtually unknown and local 
people (few of whom had ever seen Europeans) were engaged in continuous tribal 
skirmishing and were highly suspicious of outsiders. While still in England, Burck-
hardt embarked on crash courses in Arabic, astronomy and medicine, and took to 
sleeping on the ground and eating nothing but vegetables to toughen himself up.
On arrival in Aleppo in 1810, locals immediately questioned him about his strange 
accent. Burckhardt told his cover story: that he was a Muslim trader from India and 
his mother tongue wasn't Arabic but Hindustani. Suspicion persisted, and he was 
pressed to say something in Hindustani, whereupon he let loose a volley of ﬂuent 
Swiss-German - which seemed to satisfy the doubters. Burckhardt spent over two 
years in Aleppo, adopting local customs, taking the name Sheikh Ibrahim ibn 
Abdallah, perfecting his Arabic and becoming an expert in Quranic law.
In 1812, Burckhardt set off for Cairo, recording everything that he saw in a secret 
journal: had he been found out, no doubt he would have been killed as a spy. Around 
Karak, he heard the locals talking of an ancient city locked away in the heart of an 
impenetrable mountain. His curiosity was aroused, but there was no way he could 
openly declare an interest without bringing suspicion onto himself: a genuine devotee 
of Islam would know that such ruins were the work of inﬁdels and of no concern. 
the power vacuum in Transjordan and extend their kingdom far beyond Petra. 
By 80 BC they were in control of Damascus. Petra grew ever more wealthy on 
its profits from trade, standing at the pivots between Egypt, Arabia and Syria, 
and between East Asia and the Mediterranean. Traditional commodities such as 
copper, iron and Dead Sea bitumen, used for embalming in Egypt, were 
losing ground to spices from the southern Arabian coast - myrrh, balsam and 
frankincense, the last of which was central to religious ritual all over the Hellen-
istic world. Pepper, ginger, sugar and cotton arrived from India for onward 
distribution. Chinese documents even talk of imports of silk, glass, gold, silver, 
henna and frankincense from a place known as Li-Kan, taken to be a corruption 
of "Reqem". Nabatean power seemed limitless, and even when Pompey sent 
troops against Petra in 62 BC, the Nabateans were able to buy peace from the 
Roman Empire for the price of three hundred talents of silver. Petran prosperity 
grew and grew.
Petra's golden age
The first centuries BC and AD saw Petra at its zenith, with a settled population 
of perhaps as many as 30,000. The Roman author Strabo describes it as a 
wealthy, cosmopolitan city, full of fine buildings and villas, gardens and water-
courses, with Romans and other foreigners thronging the streets, and a 
democratic king. "The Nabateans," reported Strabo, "are so acquisitive that they 
give honours to those who increase their possessions, and publicly fine those 
who lose them." However, the writing was on the wall. The discovery of the 
monsoon winds had begun to cause a shift in trade patterns: overland routes 
from Arabia were being abandoned in favour of transport by sea. In addition, 
Rome was sponsoring the diversion of inland trade away from the upstart Petra,

instead directing it into Egypt and via the Wadi Sirhan into Syria, presaging the 
rise of Palmyra. Pressure on Nabatea to come to heel was inexorable. The last 
Nabatean king, Rabbel II, tried moving his capital from Petra north to Bosra, 
but eventually had to strike a deal with Rome. On his death in 106 AD the 
entire Nabatean kingdom passed peacefully into Roman hands.
The Roman, Byzantine and Crusader eras
Under the Romans, Petra became a principal centre of the new Provincia 
Arabia, and seems to have undergone something of a cultural renaissance, with 
the theatre and Colonnaded Street both being renovated. The city was 
important enough to be visited by Emperor Hadrian in 130 AD, and possibly 
also by Emperor Severus in 199. However, the tide of history was turning, and 
by 300 Petra was in serious decline, with houses and temples falling derelict 
through lack of maintenance. Palmyra, an oasis entrepôt in the eastern Syrian 
desert, was on the ascendant, and sea trade into Egypt was well established; Petra 
was stuck between the two, and there was no reason to keep it alive. Roman 
patronage began to drift away from the city, and entrepreneurs and merchants 
followed.
Petra's decline was drawn out. Christianity was adopted as the official 
religion of the empire in 324, but for many decades after that the proud 
Nabateans mingled elements of the new faith with remnants of their own pagan 
heritage. The massive earthquake of 363, according to the contemporary bishop 
of Jerusalem, levelled half of Petra, although the city limped on for another 
couple of centuries. In 447, the Urn Tomb was converted into a huge church, 
and both the lavishly decorated Petra Church and plainer Ridge Church
were built within the following century or so. Nonetheless, by the time of the 
Burckhardt made up a story that he had vowed to sacriﬁce a goat at the shrine of the 
Prophet Aaron atop Jebel Haroun near the ruins: an unimpeachably honourable 
motive for pressing on.
As he and his guide approached Wadi Musa (then known by its old name of Elji),
they were stopped by the Liyathneh tribe, camped near Ain Musa, who tried to 
persuade them to sacriﬁce their goat there and then, with the white shrine in plain 
view on the distant summit. But Sheikh Ibrahim insisted on going on, much to the 
irritation of his guide. They went down the steep hill, on into the Siq, and arrived at 
the Treasury. Burckhardt somehow managed to make detailed notes and a sketch of 
the facade, and they continued throughout the city in this way, Burckhardt writing 
and sketching in secret, his guide becoming ever more suspicious. They reached the 
foot of Jebel Haroun as dusk was falling, and Burckhardt ﬁnally submitted to his 
guide's insistence that they make the sacriﬁce and turn back.
Burckhardt's adventures continued: he arrived in Cairo to prepare for his great 
African expedition, but quickly got tangled in bureaucracy. In the meantime he 
travelled deep into Nubia, crossed the Red Sea to Jeddah (and was probably the ﬁrst 
Christian ever to enter Mecca, where his Quranic learning deeply impressed the city's 
religious judge), and explored Sinai, but back in Egypt in 1817, he contracted 
dysentery and died in eleven days, with his journey to the Niger not even begun. All 
Burckhardt's journals were published after his death, Travels in Nubia and Travels in 
Arabia overshadowed by the news of his rediscovery of Petra, published in 1822 in 
Travels in Syria and the Holy Land. His grave, bearing his pseudonym Sheikh 
Ibrahim, is visitable in a Muslim cemetery in Cairo. Its existence shows that, far from 
being simply a game or ploy, Burckhardt's alter ego took on a genuine life of its own.

PETRA |

seventh-century Islamic invasion, Petra was more or less deserted, and the earth-
quake of 749 probably forced the final stragglers to depart the crumbling city.
On their push through Transjordan in the early twelfth century, the Crusaders
built small forts within Petra at Al-Habees and Wu'ayra, though these were 
tiny outposts of their headquarters at nearby Shobak and were abandoned less 
than a century later. In 1276, the Mamluke sultan Baybars - on his way from 
Cairo to suppress a revolt in Karak - entered Petra from the southwest and 
proceeded through the deserted city "amidst most marvellous caves, the facades 
sculptured into the very rock face". He emerged from the Siq on June 6, 1276, 
and, as far as records show, was the last person, other than the local bedouin, to 
see Petra for over five hundred years.
The modern era
On August 22, 1812, a Swiss explorer, Jean Louis Burckhardt (see box, p.264), 
entered the Siq in heavy Arab disguise in the company of a local guide. His 
short visit, and the notes and sketches he managed to make, brought the fable 
of Petra to the attention of the world once again. In May 1818, two commanders 
of the British Royal Navy, Charles Irby and James Mangles, spent some days 
sightseeing in the ancient city, but it was the visits of Léon de Laborde in 1826 
and the British artist David Roberts in 1839 that first brought plentiful images 
of Petra to the West. Laborde's engravings were often fanciful and cloyingly 
romanticized, but Roberts's drawings were relatively accurate. As well as helping 
to shape the legend of Petra in Western minds - Burgon's oft-quoted line 
about the "rose-red city" (see p.288) appeared within a few years - they also 
launched tourism to the place. The second half of the nineteenth century saw 
a steady trickle of earnest visitors, even though Petra was still a destination way 
off any beaten tracks, reached only with extreme hardship by horse or camel 
from Jerusalem. Serious archeological investigation began at the turn of the 
century, with specialists cataloguing all Petra's monuments in 1898 and 
producing the first accurate maps in 1925.
By this time, the Thomas Cook Travel Company had set up a camp in Petra 
for European tourists, offering the choice of tent or cave accommodation; until 
a regular bus service from Amman began in 1980, facilities around the site 
remained minimal. Wadi Musa town was a backwater, despite the designation of 
Petra as a national park. In the early 1980s, after protracted but fruitless negotia-
tions, the government ordered the Bdul tribe (see p.293), who had been 
resident in Petra's caves for as long as anyone could remember, to move out to 
Umm Sayhoun, a purpose-built settlement of small breezeblock houses 4km 
away. The prospect of electricity, running water, health care and better education 
for the kids proved irresistible, and, in dribs and drabs, the Bdul departed. Devel-
opment of the site and archeological exploration then took off: Petra was added 
to UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites in 1985, and four years later a group 
of concerned local establishment figures set up the Petra National Trust
(PNT; Wwww.petranationaltrust.org), a not-for-profit NGO campaigning on 
issues of the environment, antiquities and the region's cultural heritage.
Today a buffer zone of over 900 square kilometres of land, from Shobak to 
well south of Rajif, is formally protected, while a core 264 square kilometres 
around the site itself is defined as the strictly regulated Petra Archeological 
Park (Wwww.petrapark.com). Recent years have seen a host of new projects, 
ranging from ongoing digs at several locations to major engineering works 
repaving the Siq, installing upgraded tourist facilities around the site and beauti-
fying Wadi Musa town.

Wadi Musa
WADI MUSA is an anomaly, a dusty southern Jordanian town given an 
unfamiliar twist with lots of signs in English, a huge number of hotels and a 
noticeable diminution in the usual hospitality towards foreigners. In sharp 
contrast to the rest of Jordan, where decency and respect are the unswerving 
norm, Wadi Musa shows a distressing tendency towards rip-offs, wheedling and 
outright hassle. Businesses and individuals all too often overcharge and under-
deliver. It's a badly run, seedy little place.
If you stay for a while you may pick up on the town's rather sad air of 
powerlessness. This is epitomized by the local farmers and small-business 
people who are well aware that their hands are tied (either by decision-
makers who don't always put local interests first or by regional instability that 
can decimate the town's income for months on end), and exemplified by the 
substandard hotels serviced by bored, lonely guest workers from Egypt and 
northern Jordan, who see little of the whirlwinds of cash that blow into town 
with every tour bus.
Arrival
All main roads to Petra meet just above Ain Musa, a spring in the hills to the 
east of Wadi Musa town which is marked by a small triple-domed building 
sheltering a rock - traditionally, the rock struck in anger by Moses - from 
beneath which the spring emerges. From here, the whole of Wadi Musa town 
is strung out for 4km along a main road which heads downhill all the way, 
offering spectacular views out over the craggy mountains and eventually termi-
nating at the ticket gate into Petra.
Partway down is an intersection known as the Police Roundabout (Wadi 
Musa's police station is alongside it), from where a turn-off heads left through 
residential districts towards the neighbouring village of Taybeh and eventually 
out of town, passing big hotels such as the Marriott on the way.
The centre of Wadi Musa, just below the police intersection, is marked by the 
small Shaheed Roundabout, although there are no signs naming it (it's often 
dubbed the Central, or Midtown, Roundabout instead). Clustered near here are 
most of Wadi Musa's shops, banks, mosques, cafés and hotels, as well as the bus 
station.
At the bottom of the hill from the town centre is a strip known as the Tourist 
Street, with hotels, cafés and restaurants on one side and the valley bed on the 
other. It ends at the landmark Mövenpick hotel, with the Petra Visitor Centre and 
ticket gate just beyond.

By car
From Amman, the most direct route to Petra is 235km, safely driveable in 
around two and a half hours (without stops). Head south from 7th or 8th Circle 
on the Desert Highway past the airport: after 180km you'll come to the 
Unayza junction, which has a signposted turn-off west to Petra. From here, a 
smooth, upgraded road takes you quickly and easily on to Wadi Musa through 
Shobak; partway along it joins the King's Highway. Follow it straight all the way 
and it delivers you to Ain Musa.

If you fancy a slower, more scenic approach, opt for a beautiful backroad. 
About 16km south of Shobak town, you'll see a right turn signposted to Hisha 
and Beidha. This narrow, twisting road leads through the trees up to the crest of 
a ridge, where you suddenly get expansive views out over Petra's valley and the 
jagged peaks beyond. Carry on down (the straight line of a road visible on the 
valley floor points directly at a cleft in the mountains - this is "Little Petra"; see 
p.311). Take the signposted left turn just before you reach Little Petra (10km 
from the King's Highway), and you enter Wadi Musa the back way, passing

through rolling desert terrain and the Bdul village at Umm Sayhoun before 
ending up, 8km on, at the Mövenpick hotel.
Coming from Aqaba or Rum, the main highway climbs out of the desert 
to crest the plateau at Ras an-Naqab. A left turn here, at the top of the hill, takes 
you onto the southernmost stretch of the King's Highway, leading across the 
rolling fields to the village of Taybeh; from here, the road, unofficially known 
as the Scenic Road, clings to the cliffside, passing several big hotels and some 
spectacular views over the Petra mountains until it arrives at the Police Round-
about in central Wadi Musa.
From Ma'an, the quickest route is the signposted road through Udhruh, 
which meets the Shobak road just above Ain Musa: 33km in total.
By bus and serveece
From Amman buses and serveeces run from Wihdat station (via the Desert 
Highway) - most reliably in early morning and mid-afternoon, though on 
Fridays there may be nothing after midday. See p.121 for more details. From 
Aqaba three or four buses arrive in the morning and early afternoon (more 
details on p.353), from Wadi Rum there is just one morning bus a day (p.324), 
and you might find one afternoon bus from Karak (p.246). More frequent 
buses arrive from Ma'an and Shobak, but these towns are hardly high on most 
visitors' agenda. Buses on all routes are restricted - or nonexistent - on Fridays. 
Bear in mind that if you want to get to Petra from Amman, Aqaba or just about 
any other town in southern Jordan, and there are no direct buses, take a bus to 
Ma'an instead: frequent connections leave Ma'an for Wadi Musa, or it's easy to 
find a taxi for around JD10.
Wadi Musa's bus station is in the centre of town, down the hill behind the 
main mosque about 300m south of the Shaheed Roundabout. Instead of being 
PETRA | Wadi Musa: Arrival
Moving on from Wadi Musa
Two or three buses to Amman's Wihdat station (via the Desert Highway) - plus a few 
serveeces - depart between 6 and 8am, with another couple of bus departures 
around 11am-1pm. The last bus to Amman is a coach run by the JETT company, 
which leaves from the Visitor Centre daily at 4.30pm (JD7; buy tickets from Jeff's 
Bookshop near the Visitor Centre; driver's mobile T077 731 0850) and drops off at 
the JETT ofﬁce in Abdali (see p.86). Two or three buses to Aqaba leave between 6 
and 8am, plus another one at around 3-4pm. One bus leaves to Wadi Rum at about 
6am. There might be a bus to Karak (via the Desert Highway) at about noon. Fares 
for all these are in the order of JD4-6. Journey times are given in "Travel details" at 
the end of this chapter.
These few routes are all very popular, and you should book seats in advance. Ask 
your hotel manager the day before to reserve you a place on a bus for the next 
morning. All buses start from the bus station, but if you've reserved a seat the bus 
should come to your hotel's door. If you're not ready when it arrives, it won't wait.
Buses leave hourly until mid-afternoon for Ma'an, which has fairly frequent connec-
tions to Amman, Aqaba and Karak. There are also regular buses to Shobak, which 
has no connections to anywhere but is a good place to start a hitch up the King's 
Highway to Qadisiyyeh and beyond.
If you know you must travel on a Friday - when there are far fewer buses - check 
schedules in advance with your hotel.
Chartering a taxi to Rum costs about JD40, to Aqaba JD40, to Karak JD50-55, to 
Amman on the Desert Highway JD75, or to Amman along the King's Highway JD100 
or more.

271
dropped here, you could ask the bus driver to let you out at the hotel of your 
choice along the way. In a serveece you're more likely to find that the driver 
"recommends" a particular hotel by taking you to the door: he does this to earn 
a commission from the hotel, who will correspondingly charge you more for 
your room. Be aware that hotels which encourage this kind of deception are 
unlikely to be the best in town. See p.121 for details of similar scams employed 
by some Wadi Musa serveece drivers.
Alternative methods of arrival include a morning coach run daily by the 
JETT company from their Abdali office in Amman (details on p.121); note that 
this drops off only at the Visitor Centre down by the gate, not at the bus station. 
There is also a private bus arriving daily from Madaba via the King's 
Highway operated by the Mariam Hotel - full details on p.224.
Town transport
The only means of transport within Wadi Musa is taxi. The standard tourist rate 
for a ride through town - from the Petra ticket gate to Ain Musa or anywhere 
in between - is JD2, but to reach that figure you'll have to bargain hard each 
time. There are always plenty of taxis sharking around the streets; to book one, 
call T03 215 6777 or ask at your hotel reception.
The walk along the main road between the town centre and the Petra gate is 
2km - easy going down, miserable going up, especially after a full day of 
walking in Petra. Some hotels offer free transport to and from the gate in the 
morning and the evening; check details in advance.
Accommodation
Wadi Musa has accommodation to suit all budgets. There are dozens of 
hotels, but many are drab mid-range places without much style or comfort; 
our recommendations pick out the best. Low-budget travellers have several 
recommendable places, but the few luxury hotels are acceptable, if rarely 
outstanding. Service is almost universally poor.
Hotel prices here are more open to bargaining than anywhere else in Jordan, 
especially in the low seasons (June-Aug & Nov-Feb). En-suite bathrooms are 
offered as standard in virtually all hotels above budget level. Another feature of 
Wadi Musa is that all hotels have rates for "room only", "bed and breakfast" and 
"half-board" (breakfast and dinner, though meals in some of the smaller places can 
be skimpy): make sure you confirm what you want when you check in.
Campsites
The best campsite in the Petra area is the A Ammarin Camp (T079 975 5551, 
Wwww.bedouincamp.net; 3), a bedouin-style permanent encampment run by 
the Ammareen tribe, and located in a beautiful, quiet spot out near "Little Petra" 
Information

ofﬁcial website Wwww.petrapark.com - and then compare with the unofﬁcial site

of booking guides, turn to p.278.

(see p.311): from the Little Petra access road, you turn off at the signpost and drive 
for 1km on a marked dirt-track to reach the campsite, which is tucked away out 
of site behind a crag. A taxi here from Wadi Musa would cost about JD8-10.
The site has a series of long, low bedouin goat-hair tents divided up into 
sections and given concrete floors: you sleep on reasonably comfortable beds 
with mattresses, and there is a block with proper, flushing toilets plus hot and 
cold running water. The big plus is that you are completely away from the hustle 
and bustle of Wadi Musa, nestling in amongst the mountains under a starry sky - 
and that your money is going straight to the Ammareen community co-operative. 
The experience is wonderful - and being able to escape from Wadi Musa for a 
night or two is a great relief. The rate given above (3) covers bed and breakfast. 
Other meals are available, but if you're watching the pennies try and self-cater: 
dinner - though delicious, and comprising a range of hot and cold dishes served 
around the campfire - is charged at a hefty JD35 per person. You can also pitch 
your own tent here (JD15pp) or park a motor-home (JD20).
As you drive between Petra and Little Petra, you'll see off to the side of the 
road a couple more "luxury camps", most prominently the King Aretas Camp. 
These are run by tour company entrepreneurs, and are neither luxurious nor 
attractive - yet have the gall to charge JD80-100 per person half-board. Avoid.
Inexpensive hotels
The main thing to look out for in a budget hotel in Wadi Musa is heating: 
summer nights are pleasantly cool (several of the better hotels offer cut-price 
rates for sleeping on a mattress on the roof), but all during winter and even as 
late as April, mornings and evenings can be chilly. Location is also an issue: you 
have to weigh up whether you'd rather pay more to be closer to the Petra gate, 
or would prefer to be up in the town centre near cafés and shops.
If you're travelling on a budget, be aware that Wadi Musa is unique: unlike 
anywhere else in Jordan there are people involved in the lower echelons of the 
tourism industry here who unashamedly target backpackers for money or sex 
(or both). If you keep your ear to the ground, and monitor the online travel 
forums, you'll come across stories of pushy staff at particular hotels, rip-off taxi-
drivers, restaurant owners playing the gigolo, and worse. If we haven't reviewed 
a particular hotel here, there's probably a good reason why you should avoid it. 
Common petty deceptions include paying taxi-drivers to bring tourists to the 
door (and then charging the tourists extra to make up) and/or setting a loss-
leading room rate of, say, 3JD per person before extracting profit on meals, 
transport, internet, beers and so on: one particularly lucrative line is in touting 
cheap desert tours of Wadi Rum (for more on this, see p.326). As far as harass-
ment goes, a favoured ploy is to offer to show visitors some amazing remote 
viewpoint, or invite guests to an evening meal at a special desert campsite. 
Women on their own in Wadi Musa should never accept such an offer.
All the hotels listed below are marked on the map on p.268.

balcony. Lack of heating lets it down. Go for the 
en-suite rooms on the upper ﬂoor. 1
Cleopetra T03 215 7090 or 077 658 
2384, Ecleopetra_h@hotmail.com. One of 
the best budget hotels in Wadi Musa, run by the 
affable, knowledgeable and traveller-savvy Mosleh 
Farajat. Rooms are clean, comfortable and good 
value; by the time you read this, the plans for 
expansion may also be complete, which means 
bigger, better rooms and more facilities. Rates 
include a good breakfast, free transport to and 
from the Petra gate and free drinks. An excellent 
choice. 1-2
Moon Valley T03 215 7131, Ehotelmoonvalley
@yahoo.com. A decent choice located a short walk 
down the hill from Wadi Musa town centre. Rooms 
are comfortable and reasonable value, and service 
is relatively forthcoming. 3

Mid-range hotels
There's a large number of mid-range hotels in Wadi Musa, almost all of them 
existing for tour-group business (and few of them with rooms or service 
standards as good as they should be). Rates for individuals are frequently much 
higher but you can limit the damage by reserving well ahead; if you arrive 
without a reservation, it pays to shop around. Hotels close to the gate charge 
considerably more than those back in town. 
All the hotels listed below are marked on the map on p.268.
Al-Anbat I T03 215 6265, Wwww
.alanbat.com. Great value, with friendly 
service and a cosy atmosphere. These rooms -
in the main building and the four-ﬂoor rear 
extension - are some of the largest in Wadi Musa: 
airy and spacious, with high ceilings, decent 
furniture and balconies offering exceptional 
sunset views from this elevated location high 
above Wadi Musa town. Free transport to and 
from the gate, a place to pitch a tent (or park a 
caravan) and good meals add to the appeal. There 
are more, cheaper rooms at the Al-Anbat II
annexe down in the town centre. 4
Amra Palace T03 215 7070, Wwww
.amrapalace.com. Decent three-star hotel on a 
quiet backstreet in the town centre - big, too, with 
72 rooms - that has attractive pine decor, a nice 
little palm-shaded garden and a covered swimming 
pool. It's used chieﬂy by whistle-stop tour groups, 
which means both service and ambience aren't 
what they should be, but the quality of rooms can 
make up for that. 5-6
Candles T03 215 5333, Ecandles@nets.com.jo. 
An uninspired three-star, which only just scrapes a 
recommendation here - partly for its location, a 
short walk from the Petra gate, and partly for its 
upper-ﬂoor rooms, particularly the corner room 101 
and the junior suite 311, both of which offer space 
and views that make up for the small and disap-
pointing bathrooms. Bargain them down. 5
Flowers T03 215 6771, Eﬂowershotel
@hotmail.com. Comfortable but cramped 
two-star rooms are slightly overpriced, but only 
because of the hotel's great location, a short 
walk from the Petra gate. With on-the-ball 
management and a returning clientele of small-
group hiking tour companies, it's popular and 
often full. 4
Petra Moon T03 215 6220, Wwww
.petramoonhotel.com. Well-kept little two-star 
hotel a short walk from the Petra gate, with 
clean, comfortable en-suite doubles (some 
offering ﬁne views) and spot-on service from 
easy-going manager Samir Nawaﬂeh, who offers 
Rough Guide readers a ten percent discount on 
request. 4
Silk Road T03 215 7222, Wwww.petrasilkroad
.com. Characterful, pleasant upper-three-star on 
the tourist street down by the Petra gate, frequently 
used by tour groups and excellent value for money. 
Renovated throughout in 2008, including with new 
beds and mattresses. A reliable hotel with a 
reputation to uphold. 6
Valley Stars Inn T03 215 5733, Wwww
.valleystarsinn.com. The closest Petra gets to 
a boutique hotel, located slightly above the town 
centre: just eight rooms, spacious, clean and quiet, 
with stone-tiled ﬂoors and stylish interiors. A great 
choice for individual travellers seeking to escape the 
demands of Petra's mass-market tourism. 4-5
PETRA | Wadi Musa: Accommodation
The Valentine Inn is a busy backpacker hotel in the middle of Wadi Musa. If you google 
it, you'll ﬁnd mixed reviews. However, please note that Rough Guides do not 
recommend the Valentine Inn as a place to stay.
Mussa Spring T03 215 6310, 
Emusaspring_hotel@yahoo.co.uk, 
Wwww.geocities.com/mussaspring. Long-standing 
backpackers' favourite, situated right up beside Ain 
Musa, with friendly, efﬁcient staff and a sociable 
atmosphere. Rooms are basic but clean: there are 
singles, doubles and dorms, both en suite and with 
shared bathrooms. Rates include free transport to 
and from the gate. 1-2
el-Rashid T03 215 6800, Erashid@joinnet
.com.jo. Decent option overlooking the central round-
about, with clean, cosy and quiet rooms, relatively 
amenable service and a good reputation. 3-4
Sunset T03 215 6579, Wwww.petrasunset.com. 
The only budget hotel on the tourist street close to 
the gate - and it's a surprisingly good option. Rooms 
are all en suite; some are a bit too poky for comfort, 
but most are perfectly adequate, if characterless. 2

274
Beit Zaman T03 215 7401, Efront
.ofﬁce@beitzaman.com, Wwww.jordan
tourismresorts.com & Wwww.beitzaman.com. 
Eye-popping ﬁve-star hotel that occupies the old 
Nawaﬂeh quarter of Wadi Musa, spreading back up 
the hillside within the town. The old stone cottages 
of this traditional village-within-a-village have been 
converted into luxury rooms - 129 of them, 
covering an area of 43,000 square metres. (Unless 
you phone reception for a golf-cart, be prepared to 
do a bit of walking.) The hugely spacious rooms - 
some with balcony - have been tastefully 
appointed, with traditional fabrics and rugs set 
against rough sandstone blocks, part-exposed, 
part-plastered in white. The hotel includes a ﬁne-
dining restaurant and Wadi Musa's largest 
swimming pool. 9
Crowne Plaza T03 215 6266, Wwww.cprpetra
.com. A decent, reliable ﬁve-star hotel, located very 
close to the gate (a short stroll from the Visitor 
Centre); this is a favourite with individuals and 
upscale tour groups alike. The design of the hotel is 
a bit old-fashioned (it was built in the 1980s), and 
rooms are comfortable but bland. It's worth visiting 
to sit out on their poolside, perched in front of the 
rocky ravines - especially at night when ﬂoodlights 
illuminate the mountains. Its Guesthouse annexe, 
right beside the gate, is less pricey, but is usually 
given over exclusively to tour groups. 9
Golden Tulip Kings' Way T03 215 6799, 
Wwww.goldentulipkingsway.com. Pleasant, if 
generic, four-star choice up at Ain Musa, with 
comfortable (though rather cramped) rooms and 
attentive service. This place makes for an 
especially good choice in summer, when it can be 
noticeably cooler and more pleasant up here than 
in the town. However, no free rides are offered 
down to the gate. 8-9
Marriott T03 215 6407, Wwww.marriott.com
/mpqmc. An excellent ﬁve-star choice, located 
4.5km out of town high up on the Scenic Road, 
with spectacular views over the mountains. Public 
areas are comfortable but not excessively grand, 
and there's a good swimming pool with a 
panoramic view across the valley. Rooms are good, 
with big windows, well-appointed bathrooms and 
large beds. Service is outstanding - perhaps the 
best in Wadi Musa. 9
Mövenpick T03 215 7111, Wwww
.movenpick-petra.com. Petra's top choice, 
superbly designed in traditional Damascene style 
right down to the last exquisite detail. The 
stunning four-storey courtyard atrium, with its 
mosaic-tiled fountain and palm trees, vies for 
gasps with the adjacent bar, its hand-painted walls 
inlaid with turquoise and gold leaf, and featuring 
hand-carved wooden screens and embroidered 
fabrics. The guest rooms are immaculate, service 
is calm and efﬁcient, and the location - metres 
from the Petra gate - ideal. Don't miss the roof 
garden at sunset. Its sister property, the similarly 
grand Mövenpick Nabatean Castle, located 6.5km 
out on the Scenic Road, is often used only for tour 
groups and sometimes has restricted opening: 
check with the main hotel. 9
Petra Palace T03 215 6723, Wwww
.petrapalace.com.jo. A ﬁne local four-star hotel on 
the main tourist street near the Petra gate - 
extended ﬁrst in 2007 and then in stages there-
after, eventually reaching 170 rooms in total. The 
exterior and lobby are lavish; some rooms in the 
older wing are merely competent, but the newer 
rooms are bigger and better appointed, some with 
poolside access. A very popular choice with tour 
groups from around the world: as an individual, 
bargain hard to bring the rate down. 7-8
Taybet Zaman T03 215 0111, Ereservation
@taybetzaman.com, Wwww.jordantourismresorts
.com & Wwww.taybetzaman.com. Award-winning 
luxury hotel built on the old Ottoman quarter of 
Taybeh village, 11km from Wadi Musa. Each old 
cottage is now a self-contained single or double 
"room", tastefully furnished and ﬁtted out to inter-
national ﬁve-star standard; there are restaurants, 
bars, a pool, Turkish bath, shops and two heliports 
tucked away in different corners of the "village", 
which is separated off from the rest of workaday 
Taybeh by a high perimeter wall. The only thing 
lacking, of course, is any kind of original atmos-
phere: this place is now ﬁrmly on the tourist map 
and is often heaving with groups, at which times 
service standards suffer badly. 9
PETRA | Wadi Musa: Accommodation
Luxury hotels
At the luxury end of the scale, global chains - Marriott, Crowne Plaza, 
Mövenpick - compete with homegrown five-star hotels such as the award-
winning Taybet Zaman and Beit Zaman. But, in general, Petra is surprisingly 
poorly served: at such a famous location you might expect world-class design, 
top-level facilities and impeccable service, but none of the hotels on offer 
truly matches up in all areas. All the hotels listed below are marked on the 
map on p.268.

The Town
There's not much to do in Wadi Musa. Attempts to create an artisans' quarter 
in Elgee, a cluster of restored stone cottages behind the town centre (and also 
the original name for the Wadi Musa settlement), have come to nothing: it's 
pleasant to stroll here, away from the bustle, but there's nothing to see or buy.
The best shopping is down on the Tourist Street near the gate, where you'll 
find a string of craft and souvenir shops, selling postcards and trinkets as well 
as rugs and antiques. Several are the retail outlets for local women's cooperatives, 
selling handmade crafts, while the Sand Castle shop is notable for its high-
quality antiques, including pieces in copper, brass, silver and wood from Syria, 
Yemen and elsewhere, as well as handwoven carpets. Nearby on the same street 
is the Made In Jordan gallery and gift shop, run by the Petra Moon tour 
company. Here, the crafts come from charitable suppliers such as the Royal 
Society for the Conservation of Nature, the Jordan River Foundation, the Noor 
al-Hussein Foundation and the Royal Marine Conservation Society (JREDS) 
- all of which employ chiefly rural women (in JREDS' case, the wives and 
daughters of Aqaba fishermen) to produce traditional crafts and handmade 
items of the highest quality. Also on show are pieces made by individual artisans 
from Wadi Musa and around Jordan.
The same building hosts the Petra Kitchen, an idea (also by Petra Moon) to 
give added perspective to a Petra visit. This is not a true restaurant; rather, it is 
a way for a small number of visitors at a time to get hands-on experience of 
local culture by working with a team of Wadi Musa women to prepare ingre-
dients, cook an evening meal and then eat together. Under guidance you chop, 
mix and assemble a range of salads, soup, hot and cold mezze (starters), a main 
course such as mansaf or maqlouba, and bedouin coffee and tea - the idea being 
that you learn new culinary techniques, handle unfamiliar products and break 
the social ice at the same time. The ingredients all come from Wadi Musa or the 
nearby Dana Nature Reserve; the tableware comes from the women's ceramics 
workshop at Iraq al-Amir near Amman (see p.149); and the aprons, tablecloths 
and napkins were all hand-embroidered by women working with the Jordan 
River Foundation. To take part in the courses, which run when demand is 
Petra tour companies and guides
Down on the "Tourist Street" near the Petra ticket gate are a handful of experienced 
and well-respected tour companies who - as well as covering trips around Jordan - 
can put together short adventure-style excursions on the ﬂy. Ideas include a sunset 
horseride at Baydha, a half or full day's hiking, horseriding or mountain-biking in the 
hills above Wadi Musa, a two-day camel trek to Sabra, including full support, and so 
on. Talk ﬁrst to Petra Moon (T03 215 6665, Wwww.petramoon.com) and La
Beduina (T03 215 7099, Wwww.labeduinatours.com), then compare with Zaman
Tours (T03 215 7723, Wwww.zamantours.com) and Jordan Tours & Travel (T03
215 4666, Wwww.jordantours-travel.com).
Smaller operations, run by recommended individual guides in Wadi Musa and 
focused mainly on hiking and low-key wilderness exploration, include Jordan 
Beauty Tours (T079 558 1644, Wwww.jordanbeauty.com) and Jordan Inspiration 
Tours (T077 609 7581, Wwww.jitours.com).
To get well off the beaten track, contact the Ammareen tribe through their 
campsite at "Little Petra" (T079 975 5551, Wwww.bedouincamp.net; see also 
p.271): the website is very detailed, and includes outlines of guided treks on foot and 
by camel through areas of southern Jordan little known to outsiders.
PETRA | Wadi Musa: The Town

276
Arabi one of Wadi Musa's best local 
restaurants, located just up from the main 
roundabout. It's always busy, and does a wide 
range of basic dishes - falafel, hummus, fuul, 
salads, kebabs and more, served with fresh ﬂat 
bread. The place is clean, staff are friendly and 
prices are low: a meal shouldn't cost you more 
than JD4-5.
Bukhara a sociable restaurant in the town centre, 
with streetside tables offering views of the 
mountains. The speciality is grilled meat: mouthwa-
teringly aromatic smoke from the barbecuing 
kebabs regularly wafts over the street. A locals' 
favourite.
Cleopetra restaurant not to be confused 
with the Cleopetra hotel, this is an OK diner, 
empty during the day but often crowded with 
shawerma-munching locals at night. Avoid the 
rather tasteless buffet meals, however.
Mövenpick hotel T03 215 7111. The hotel's 
Al-Saraya restaurant (daily 6.30-10.30pm) has a 
lavish buffet, from fresh vegetables wok-fried as 
you watch, through gourmet breads, kebabs, fresh 
ﬁsh and an array of salads to proper Black Forest 
gateau, everything top quality. It's not cheap (about 
JD20-25), but the quality and variety are excellent. 
When there is enough business - that is, when 
they have a tour group who aren't inside Petra - 
they also do a buffet lunch here (noon-3.30pm). 
Alongside, but several notches up the scale, 
Al-Iwan (daily 7-11.30pm) offers seriously sophis-
ticated à la carte dining for JD50 and up. In 
addition, the hotel bakery shop (daily 9am-7pm) 
sells delicious croissants and fresh-baked loaves. If 
Eating inside Petra
There are only limited facilities for eating once you get inside Petra - and prices are 
higher than usual (understandable, considering everything has to be trucked in). 
Along the path near the theatre are stalls offering tea and snacks, while around the 
Qasr al-Bint you'll ﬁnd some tent cafés offering adequate - sometimes pretty good 
- buffet lunches for about JD10 or so.
The only proper restaurant inside Petra is the Basin (daily 11.30am-4pm, 
depending on weather conditions; T03 215 6266), located beneath shady tree cover 
opposite the Qasr al-Bint. It is run by the Crowne Plaza hotel, with whom it's not a 
bad idea to book in advance: busy times can see tour groups occupying every table. 
Buffet lunch, including a full range of salad dishes, falafel, barbecue/kebabs and 
dessert, costs JD15.50. To be honest it's barely worth it: unless you're a dedicated 
carnivore, go for the salads-only option, at half the price. They have cold beer in cans 
and on draught (JD5-7).
Your best option is to carry supplies with you for the day. All hotels can provide a 
lunchbox on request - from a budget hotel, reckon on JD3-5 for bread, cheese, fruit, 
yoghurt and a drink. Groceries and minimarkets in the centre of Wadi Musa can 
provide simple picnic fare, but nothing so energy-sustaining as nuts or dried fruit. The 
Sanabel bakery, just below the Shaheed Roundabout, is open from before dawn. Bear 
in mind that in the summer you'll need to be drinking four or ﬁve litres of water a day, 
possibly more; unless you can carry it all, you should budget on shelling out JD1-2 at 
the tent cafés for water or a soft drink to keep yourself hydrated along the way.
PETRA | Wadi Musa: The Town
sufficient (generally every evening in high season) you must book in advance
with the Petra Moon tour company (T03 215 6665, Wwww.petramoon.com). 
They can also extend the concept to run as a five-day culinary course, 
including exploratory trips to local markets and different menus each night.
Eating and drinking
For eating in Wadi Musa, most travellers either stick with whatever's on offer 
in their hotel or end up chewing pizza at one of the distinctly ordinary restau-
rants on the Tourist Street down by the Petra gate. There are some better places 
up in town. As usual, though, the only places for drinking alcohol are in the 
big hotels or a couple of specifically designated bars. All places listed here are 
marked on the map on p.000.

277
PETRA | Petra
all this is beyond you, settle for Swiss ice cream in 
the stunning atrium.
Petra Kitchen not a true restaurant, but still one of 
Petra's best dining experiences. See "The Town" 
account above.
Red Cave a good choice on the Tourist St near the 
gate. The interior is large and cool, and the food is 
excellent, including - among many staple dishes 
- a bedouin gallaya (rice with lamb or chicken in 
a spicy tomato/onion sauce). Reckon on a meal for 
around JD6.
Rose City Restaurant close to the gate, a basic, 
inexpensive diner with an all-day buffet and a 
handful of à la carte staples.
al-Wadi passable food, with pleasant terrace 
tables set out in the evening overlooking the 
town-centre roundabout. However poor service 
can let it down - and some of the staff imagine 
themselves to be God's gift to women.
Wadi Hadhramaut wonderful little 
restaurant in the town centre, with no 
English sign (it's diagonally opposite Bukhara), 
named after a desert area of eastern Yemen. 
Though the chefs are Egyptian, and the clientele 
Jordanian, the signature dish is a Yemeni mandi
- a delicious concoction of tender chicken, 
vegetables, spices, nuts and labneh yoghurt laid 
over a bed of rice.
al-Wardeh al-Shamieh a reliable choice (also 
signed as Shami Flower) in the town centre serving 
simple, good-quality Arabic food. Don't expect to 
pay the same price as the locals, however: an 
ordinary nosh here of hummus, falafel and tea is 
likely to cost as much as JD5.
Listings
Hammams steam the dust out of your pores in a 
hammam - either ﬁve-star versions in the big 
hotels (notably the Marriott) or simpler establish-
ments in Wadi Musa town centre such as the 
pleasant but rather frenetic Salome (T03 215 
7342).
Library with half a dozen books, the elegant, 
wood-panelled Burckhardt Library (daily 
10am-10pm, roughly), on the mezzanine ﬂoor of 
the Mövenpick Hotel, barely counts as a place of 
study, but it's nonetheless a cool, peaceful spot 
for some quiet downtime and is just about the 
only place in Wadi Musa where nobody's trying to 
sell you something.
Medical facilities the well-equipped Queen Rania 
Hospital - with 24hr emergency room - is about 
5km out of town on the Scenic Road towards 
Taybeh. Pharmacies in Wadi Musa town centre 
have qualiﬁed English-speaking staff.
Police in emergency, dial T191. Police patrol 
most parts of the Petra ruins in daylight hours. 
Headquarters (T03 215 6551) is off the Police 
Roundabout in Wadi Musa, while English-speaking 
tourist police are available 24hr in their main ofﬁce 
(T03 215 6441) opposite the Visitor Centre.
Post ofﬁces Wadi Musa's post ofﬁces (all daily 
8am-5pm, Fri close noon) lie at Ain Musa; beside 
Shaheed Roundabout; and 50m from the gate.
Petra
After you've finished coping with the practicalities of bed and board in Wadi 
Musa, PETRA comes as an assault on the senses. As you leave the entrance gate 
behind, the sense of exposure to the elements is thrilling; the natural drama of the 
location, the sensuous colouring of the sandstone, the stillness, heat and clarity of 
light - along with a lingering, under-the-skin quality of supernatural power that 
seems to seep out of the rock - make it an unforgettable adventure.
Whether you're in a group or alone, you'd do well to branch off the main 
routes every now and again. These days Petra sees somewhere around three 
thousand visitors a day in peak season. The place is physically large enough to 
absorb that many (although archeologists and environmentalists are both 
lobbying for controls on numbers), but the central path that runs past the major 
sights can get busy between about 10am and 4pm. Taking a ten- or fifteen-
minute detour to explore either side of the path or wander along a side-valley 

278
is a good idea, since not only does it get you out of the hubbub, but it's also 
liable to yield previously unseen views and fascinating little carved niches or 
facades. All over Petra, the Nabateans carved for themselves paths and signposts, 
shrines and houses in what seem to us remote and desolate crags.
Practicalities
The Petra Visitor Centre (daily 6am-10pm; T03 215 6020, Wwww
.petrapark.com), 50m from the gate, is the main office for information, with 
efficient, helpful staff. Core hours are 7am-6pm (4pm in winter): beforehand 
only the ticket window is open, and afterwards there are only security guards 
on duty. Inside is also a shop for books, maps and souvenirs (same times).
See the box below for details of proposed changes to the practicalities of 
visiting Petra: by the time you visit, information given in this section may be 
obsolete.
Tickets
All tickets are sold from a window beside the Visitor Centre main door. Admission 
costs a hefty JD21 for one day, JD26 for two days, or JD31 for three or four days; 
this refers to blocks of consecutive days, with no chopping and changing allowed. 
Children under 15 go free. Tickets are dated, stamped and non-transferable (you 
have to sign multi-day passes and carry ID), and they're checked at the gate as well 
as at varying points within Petra; even if you hike several kilometres out of the way 
to avoid the gate (some foolhardy folk endanger their lives doing just that), there's 
no guarantee a police officer won't pop up on some remote crag and ask to see 
your ticket. Note that "Little Petra", Baydha and Wu'ayra currently fall outside the 
(undefined) ticketed area, and so have free entry.
Round the corner from the Visitor Centre is the Petra gate, the single public 
entrance into the site (open for admission daily 6am-5pm, winter closes 4pm; 
return permitted until dusk). Following increasing concern over the damage 
done by tourism, it is forbidden for visitors to stay in Petra after sunset, and you 
may be asked to start on the long walk out well in advance. In any case it's 
potentially dangerous to do some of the longer descents (such as from the 
Monastery or the High Place) in low light.
PETRA | Petra: Practicalities
A new vision
At the time of writing, plans are in place to completely reorganize the whole way that 
visitors experience Petra. Instead of one ticket granting admission to the entire site, 
there is to be separate ticketing for each of seven marked trails: you choose in 
advance which trails you wish to follow and purchase tickets for those routes at the 
Visitor Centre (which, itself, is to be completely rebuilt). There is to be waymarking of 
trails within Petra for the ﬁrst time, along with information boards in English and 
Arabic at major sites. The Turkmaniyya road, behind the Basin restaurant, will be 
consolidated - enabling visitors to be driven out of the site, rather than facing the 
long walk back to the gate. Eco-toilets are to be installed at key points, as will more 
refreshment kiosks and rest areas. The horse-handlers will be in uniform and their 
carriages are to be redesigned for comfort and safety.
By the time you visit, much of this may already be in place - and the intention is to 
have introduced most or all of the changes by 2011. Time will tell how they impact 
on a visit.

279
Guides
The Visitor Centre is where you can hire a professional, accredited guide, at 
fixed prices (current rates are posted on the wall): JD20 for a simple 
two-and-a-half-hour tour of the major sights, or JD50 for a four-hour tour 
around the main central areas plus either the Monastery or the High Place 
of Sacrifice.
Planning your time
There's enough to explore in Petra that you could easily spend days or weeks in the 
place. Shelling out for a one-day ticket will have you running around like crazy to get 
value for money; if your pockets are deep enough, paying for four days buys time to 
pace yourself and explore to your heart's content.
Major highlights, which count as unmissable, are the Siq, the Treasury, the High
Place of Sacriﬁce, the Monastery, a walk up the Colonnaded Street, and the 
Royal Tombs. With a break for lunch, and a little time for personal exploration, seeing 
all this would occupy a pretty exhausting ten-hour day.
If you have even one extra day, your options widen considerably. Choosing an entry 
or exit route other than the Siq for one trip - via Madras, Wadi Muthlim/Mataha or 
Wadi Turkmaniyyeh - can give you a feel for outlying landscapes. Depending on your 
taste for archeology or nature, you could then devote more time to exploring the city 
centre slopes and the East Cliff, or choose one or two of the many hikes and climbs. 
You should also budget some downtime to take in the extraordinary late-afternoon 
views from the Qasr al-Bint up the Colonnaded Street towards the ﬁery East Cliff.
With "Little Petra" (Siq al-Barid) being free-entry, you should wait to take your half-
day excursion to Wu'ayra, Little Petra and, possibly, Baydha until the morning after 
your Petra ticket has expired.
Petra By Night
In times gone by, a visit to Petra wasn't complete without spending a night in the 
ruins, wandering the rocky paths by moonlight and sleeping in a tomb cave. This is 
now banned - which has led an informal group of Wadi Musa tour operators to come 
up with a new approach to Petra that aims to recapture some of that romantic spirit 
of adventure - and largely succeeds. "Petra By Night" is an after-dark guided 
excursion into the ancient city that adds an entirely new dimension to your experi-
ence of the place; the candlelit walk, leaving the lights of Wadi Musa behind to enter 
the pitch-dark valley in silence (talking and mobile phones are banned), is magical. 
Nothing can match the atmosphere of walking through the Siq at night, with only the 
light of candles placed every few metres to guide the way. The climax comes as you 
reach the Treasury plaza, where candles throw ﬂickering shadows onto the great 
facade as a bedouin musician plays on a pipe. The magic lingers while tea is served 
and you listen to a story told by a local guide.
The trip leaves every Monday, Wednesday and Thursday at 8.30pm from the Visitor 
Centre (arrive 15min early to register), and delivers you back to the Visitor Centre 
around 10.30pm. Tickets cost JD12 - and you must book in advance, either through 
your hotel or directly with a local tour company: Petra Moon (see p.275 for contact 
details) is the most reliable.
"Petra By Night" has become so popular that it's not uncommon to have 150 or 200 
people doing the walk. The best advice in these circumstances is to linger at the very 
back of the crowd: that way, you avoid most of the chatter on the way down and will 
be walking through the Siq more or less alone in the moonlight. The bedouin piper 
keeps playing until everyone has arrived at the Treasury, so you won't miss anything. 
Then there's nothing to stop you heading back early, before the crowd, for another 
lonesome walk in silence through the Siq, beneath moon and stars.

Although you can walk unguided to and from most of the main sights 
while staying this side of foolhardiness, there are still plenty of places in Petra 
where you shouldn't venture without a guide. We've mentioned this in the 
accounts below where relevant. Aside from the dangers of twisted ankles 
(or worse) scrambling around rocky cliffs, once you leave the main routes 
it's easy to lose the path. A specialist guide for a day-trip to the summit of 
Jebel Haroun, or one of the other outlying attractions, will cost upwards 
of JD100.

Horses
The Visitor Centre is also where you can book and pay for a horse to take you 
down to the Siq entrance, although at JD7 for a walk of 800m, it's not much of 
a thrill. Of this sum, JD5 goes to the owner of the horse (who is, almost without 
exception, not the person holding the reins) and JD2 goes to the Petra authori-
ties. The only income gained by the handler is in tips.
It's forbidden to ride horses through the Siq, but a horse and carriage seating 
two can be taken all the way through the Siq to the Treasury for JD20 return - also

bookable at the Visitor Centre. These are officially reserved for the elderly and 
infirm, but in practice can be booked by anyone. For the return leg, there are 
always plenty of carriages waiting for business from tired sightseers as the afternoon 
draws on, but if you arrange with a particular carriage-driver to be at the Treasury 
at a set time for your return ride, he will turn up: his fee depends on it. Resist the 
temptation to copy the many weary visitors who just get into the first carriage they 
see; this a breach of honour, and also leads to underhand competition between 
carriage-drivers to muscle in on each other's business. Ugly arguments over cash 
between two stalled carriages in the Siq are a feature of Petra afternoons.
If you see a horse or donkey being mistreated, you can refer the 
matter to the Brooke Hospital for Animals (Sat-Thurs 8am-3pm; T03 215 
6379, Wwww.thebrooke.org), an English-run charity located to the left of 
the gate.
The approach to the city
It's a walk of over 3km from the gate through to Petra's city centre, the gentle 
gradient of five percent concealing the fact that the drop in altitude (from 
1027m to 861m) is equivalent to a 45-storey skyscraper - barely noticeable on 
the way down, but murder for tired thighs on the way back up. There are three 
main sections to the walk: the Bab as-Siq area, the Siq itself and the Outer
Siq, which leads into the city centre past the Roman-style theatre.
If you have the option, you'd do well to start out as early as possible. The first 
tour groups set off by 8.30 or 9am, which brings them noisily through the 
echoing Siq to the Treasury as the sun strikes the facade (which you shouldn't 
miss). However, the experience of walking through the Siq in silence and alone 
is definitely worth at least one 6am start.
The Bab as-Siq
A modern gravel path - one side for horses, the other for pedestrians - leads 
from the gate down through a lunar landscape of white rocky domes and 
looming cliffs known as the Bab as-Siq ("Gate of the Siq"); the bed of the 
Wadi Musa, carrying water during the winter and early spring, curves alongside. 
In all but the bleached-out midday hours, the light is soft enough to pick up 
earth tones of browns and beiges in the rock, but it's only with the last rays of 
the sunset that there's any hint of the pink that Petra is famous for.
Almost immediately, you can see evidence of Nabatean endeavour: three huge 
god-blocks, 6 to 8 metres high, loom next to the path just round the first 
corner, carved probably to serve as both representations of and repositories for 
the gods to stand sentinel over the city's vital water supply. Twenty-five such 
god-blocks exist in Petra, deemed by the locals to have been the work of jinn, 
or genies, and so also termed jinn-blocks; another name is sahrij, or water-
tanks (ie tanks holding divine energy next to flowing water). The middle one 
has shaft graves cut into it, implying that it may also have served as some kind 
of funerary monument. Opposite the god-blocks are some caves, one of which 
has an obelisk carved in relief, representing the soul of a dead person. Such 
carved shrines abound in every corner of Petra's mountains, and, for those with 
time to explore, the small side-valleys off this section of the Bab as-Siq are filled 
with tombs, water channels, niches and shrines: behind the blocks, the area of 
domes known as Ramleh is cut through by parallel wadis (one of which is 
Wadi Muthlim; see p.285), and is equally explorable.
PETRA | Petra: The approach to the city

283
The Obelisk Tomb and Bab as-Siq Triclinium
The first major Nabatean monuments are a few metres further on, and - being 
on an exposed corner - badly eroded. Although apparently the upper and lower 
halves of a single monument, the Obelisk Tomb and Bab as-Siq Triclinium
may be separate entities, carved at different times. Above, four huge obelisks 
guard the entrance to a cave in the rock; such freestanding obelisks are like the 
god-blocks, representing a god and storing divine energy in a material form. 
Between the four is an eroded figure in a niche; the cave behind holds graves. 
Below, the triclinium, or dining room, is a single chamber with stone benches on 
three walls, for holding banquets in honour of the dead. On the opposite side of 
the path, 5m off the ground, is a bilingual inscription in Nabatean and Greek, 
recording that one Abdmank chose this spot to build a tomb for himself and his 
children, although it's not certain that this refers to the monuments opposite.
Just past the Obelisk Tomb is a path leading to the hidden Petran suburb of 
Madras, tucked into the hills to the left (south), from where it's possible to cross 
Nabatean religion
As much as they created a blend of Arab culture with Mediterranean, the Nabateans 
also blended inherited elements of the ancient religions of Egypt, Syria, Canaan, 
Assyria and Babylon with elements of the Greek and Roman pantheons, to create 
speciﬁcally Petran forms of worship.
Central to their religion was rock. Jehovah, the god of the Israelites was said to 
inhabit a blank rock called Bet-El ("House of God") - and this insistence on non-
ﬁgurative representation was shared by many Levantine and Arabian peoples. It was 
passed on to the Nabateans, in contrast to the Egyptians' and Assyrians' lavish 
portrayals of gods and goddesses. Concepts such as "the Lord is my rock" also 
appear many times in the Old Testament, implying an extension of the "House of 
God" idea so that the rock actually represents the deity itself. Nabatean deities were 
thus often represented simply by squared-off rocks, termed "god-blocks". In 
addition, a later development gave the rock a third aspect: that of the altar, the 
contact point between the divine and the material.
At the head of the Nabatean pantheon was Dushara, "He of the Shara" (the 
mountains around Petra), later identiﬁed with the Greek god Zeus and the Syrian 
Hadad. The fact that his name is so closely tied to the locality indicates that he may 
originally have been an Edomite, rather than a Nabatean, god. To the Nabateans, 
Dushara was the sun, the Creator, and he was often represented by an obelisk - the 
visual materialization of a beam of light striking the earth. With the mingling of Semitic 
and Mediterranean ideas, Dushara also came to be associated with Dionysus, god of 
wine, and so began to assume human form, bedecked with vines and grapes (as at 
the Nabatean temple on Jebel Tannur).
At Dushara's side were Atargatis, the goddess of fertility, of grain, fruit and ﬁsh; 
Allat (which means simply "The Goddess"), who represented the moon; Manat, the 
goddess of luck and fate, suggested to have been the patron deity of Petra and 
possibly the goddess worshipped at the Treasury; and al-Uzza ("The Mighty One"), 
assimilated with the Egyptian goddess Isis and the Roman goddesses Diana, deity 
of water and fertility, and Venus, embodied by the evening star and representing 
spiritual and erotic love. Allat, al-Uzza and Manat are all mentioned by name in the 
Quran, implying that their cult was still active and popular in Mecca as late as the 
seventh century, the time of the Prophet Muhammad.
The Nabateans also had many smaller gods, including al-Kutbay, god of writing; 
She'a-al-Qawm, the patron deity of caravans; Qos, originally an Edomite god; and 
Baal-Shamin, a Phoenician god especially popular in northern Nabatea, who had a 
temple somewhere near the modern mosque in the centre of Wadi Musa town.

the hilltops over the Jebel al-Jilf plateau, avoiding the Siq, to the top of the high, 
narrow Danqur al-Khazneh valley leading down to the Treasury; the views are 
stunning, and the sense of isolation is worth the scramble if you've already seen 
the Siq. However, the route is far from clear, relying on worn Nabatean rock-
cut stairs, and you'll need a guide.
The dam and tunnel
Back on the path, the curving northern bank of the wadi is liberally 
pockmarked with caves and niches, round to the point where the path is taken 
over the wadi bed by a bridge and the Wadi Musa itself is blocked by a dam; 
this is almost exactly the same configuration as was built by the Nabateans in 
about 50 AD, and for the same reasons: to divert the floodwaters of the Wadi 
Musa away from the Siq so that the principal entry into the city could remain 
clear year round. It's here, at the mouth of the Siq, that all horseriders must 
dismount and that entrance tickets will be checked. On the opposite bank of 
the wadi are four obelisks, one mentioning a man who lived in Reqem (Petra) 
but died in Jerash.
To the right, the Nabatean-carved, eight-metre-high tunnel - guarded by 
another, solitary god-block - enabled the floodwaters to feed into the Wadi 
Muthlim leading north around the gigantic Jebel al-Khubtha; today, this is an 
alternative way into Petra (see box, p.285).
The Siq
From the crowded, horse-smelly bridge, the path drops sharply down over the 
lip of the dam into Petra's most dramatic and awe-inspiring natural feature - the 
Siq gorge, principal entrance into the city, yet invisible until you're almost upon 
it. Overhead, the path was originally framed by an ornamental arch, which 
collapsed in 1896 although its abutments survive, decorated by the smoothed-
out remnants of niches flanked by pilasters. All the way along the left-hand wall 
is a Nabatean rock-cut water channel, and on the right-hand wall further 
along are the remains of terracotta pipes for water, both probably dating from 
the same time as the reorganization of the city water supply that prompted the 
building of the dam. At various points, you'll come across worn patches of the 
Roman/Nabatean road which originally paved the Siq along its entire length, 
in between stretches of newly consolidated pathway.
The Siq was formed when tectonic forces split the mountain in two. The 
waters of the Wadi Musa subsequently found their way into the fault, laying a 
bed of gravel and eroding the sharp corners into curves as smooth as eggshell, 
helped by the cool winds that blow in your face all the way down. The path 
along the wadi bed twists and turns between high, bizarrely eroded sandstone 
cliffs for 1200m, sometimes widening to form broad, sunlit open spaces in the 
echoing heart of the mountain, dotted with a tree or two and cut through by 
the cries of birds; in other places, the looming 150-metre-high walls close in to 
little more than a couple of metres apart, blocking out sound, warmth and even 
daylight. All the way down, high, narrow wadis feed in from either side, most of 
them blocked by modern dams (often set back to show the remains of the 
original Nabatean dams) to limit both flood danger and unauthorized explora-
tion: once you're in the Siq, the only way is onward or backward. Dotted along 
the walls at many points are small votive niches, some Greek-style with 
pediments, others with mini god-blocks. After about 350m, a small shrine has 
been carved on the downhill side of a freestanding outcrop of rock, with two 
god-blocks, the larger of which is carved with eyes and a nose. A little further 
PETRA | Petra: The approach to the city

285
on, on the left-hand wall at a sharp right-hand bend, is a merchant in Egyptian-
style dress leading two large camels; the water channel originally ran behind 
all five sets of legs, and it's just possible to trace the worn outline of the camels' 
humps in the rock wall.
When you think the gorge can't possibly go on any longer, there comes a dark, 
narrow defile, framing at its end a strip of extraordinary classical architecture. 
With your eye softened to the natural flows of eroded rock in the Siq, the clean 
lines of columns and pediments come as a revelation. As you step out into the 
daylight, there is no more dramatic or breathtaking vision in the whole of 
Jordan than the facade of the Treasury.
The Treasury
Perfectly positioned opposite the main route into Petra, the Treasury was 
designed to impress, and, two thousand years on, the effect is undiminished. 
What strikes you first is how well preserved it is; carved deep into the rockface 
and concealed in a high-walled ellipse of a valley (known as Wadi al-Jarra, "Urn 
Valley"), it has been protected from wind and rain from day one. The detailing 
of the capitals and pediments on the forty-by-thirty-metre facade is still crisp. 
The best times to view the Treasury are when the sun strikes it directly, between 
about 9 and 11am, and late in the afternoon, around 5 or 6pm, when the whole 
facade is suffused with a reflected reddish-pink glow from the walls all around.
The name "Treasury" is not Nabatean, and derives from the local name for 
such a seemingly inexplicable construction - Khaznet al-Faraoun ("Treasury 
of the Pharaoh"). Unaware of classical history, and unable to fathom why 
The Wadi Muthlim route
Although you should deﬁnitely follow the Siq into Petra at least once (and probably 
more than once, at different times of day), if you've allocated several days to a visit, 
the beautiful Wadi Muthlim is a good alternative entry route through stunning 
scenery, but taking no less than two hours to deliver you to the Nymphaeum in the 
city centre. Due to the very real danger of ﬂash ﬂoods, you shouldn't attempt it at all 
during the rainy season - roughly November to March - and even as late as May, 
there may be difﬁcult-to-avoid standing pools of water harbouring water snakes: 
wading would be a big mistake.
Before beginning the walk, you can take a small detour from the dam to the Eagle
Niche, set in the rocks 400m to the northwest. Cross the wadi over the roof of the 
tunnel and head left up the second side-valley; it's a short scramble over the smooth, 
hot rock up to a set of small niches carved in the right-hand wall, one of which 
features a strikingly carved eagle with wings outspread.
Back at the tunnel, Wadi Muthlim - full of oleanders, but with high walls cutting out 
all sound bar the occasional birdsong - is easily passable up to the remains of 
another Nabatean dam; beyond here, the path gets steadily narrower until you reach 
a point where a massive boulder all but blocks the way. It's possible to squeeze past, 
and the path continues to narrow until, with the wadi ﬂoor no wider than your foot, 
you reach a T-junction; arrows on the solid walls all around will point you left. This 
cross-wadi is the Sidd Maajn, equally narrow, but beautifully eroded by ﬂowing 
water. As you proceed, seemingly moving through the heart of the mountain, you'll 
notice the Nabateans were here before you: there are dozens of carved niches, some 
featuring pediments, other curving horns. It's around here that the way might be 
blocked by rockpools. Eventually, you'll emerge into the open Wadi Mataha (see 
p.310), about 600m northeast of Dorotheos' House, and the best part of 2km 
northeast of the Nymphaeum.
PETRA | Petra: The approach to the city

286
anyone should carve such a monument, the bedouin of Wadi Musa tagged it 
as the work of the pharaoh, lord of black magic. In pursuit of the Israelites 
after the Exodus (the legend goes), the pharaoh was slowed down by having 
to carry all his treasure, so he created the Treasury and deposited his riches in 
the urn at the very top of the facade, out of human reach. For centuries after 
Petra's abandonment, bedouin marksmen tried to shatter the urn, and so 
release the treasure, but to no avail: their only success was in blasting chunks 
off the solid urn.
 The Treasury, Petra
PETRA | Petra: The approach to the city

287
To the left of the facade, a set of stairs comes down into the valley from the 
Danqur al-Khazneh area. Off to the right, a wall blocks the narrow north end 
of the Wadi al-Jarra; if you climb over the wall, then double back to scramble 
up the rocks, you'll reach a small, jutting plateau, with a perfect view from above 
of the Treasury and the whole bustling plaza in front of it.
The Treasury facade
The carvings on the Treasury facade, though much damaged by iconoclasts, are 
still discernible and show to what extent Nabatean culture was an amalgam of 
elements from the Hellenistic and Middle Eastern worlds. 
The Treasury is normally dated to the first century BC, possibly to the 
reign of King Aretas III Philhellene ("the Greek-lover"), who brought archi-
tects to Petra from the centres of Hellenistic culture throughout the 
Mediterranean. Atop the broken pediments, framing the upper storey, are 
two large eagles, symbols of the Nabateans' chief male deity, Dushara. In a 
central position on the rounded tholos below the urn is what's been identified 
as a representation of Isis, an Egyptian goddess equated with the Nabatean 
goddess al-Uzza; in the recesses behind are two Winged Victories, although 
the remaining four figures, all of whom seem to be holding axes aloft, haven't 
been identified. Two lions, also symbolizing al-Uzza, adorn the entablature 
between the two storeys. At ground level, the mounted riders are Castor and 
Pollux, sons of Zeus. The parallel marks up the side of the facade, which 
occur in a couple of other places in Petra, may well have been footholds for 
the sculptors and masons.
One column is obviously new, a brick-and-plaster replacement for the 
original, which fell in antiquity. This neatly demonstrates one of the most 
extraordinary features of Nabatean architecture. A normal building that lost 
a main support like this would have come crashing down soon after; these 
Nabatean columns, though, support nothing. Like most of Petra's monuments, 
the entire Treasury "building" was sculpted in situ, gouged out of the unshaped 
rock in a kind of reverse architecture.
At the base of the facade, recent excavations into the four metres of gravel 
that overlie the original Nabatean surface revealed that the Treasury was carved 
above a line of older facades, also probably tombs, which are now viewable 
through a grille set into the ground.
Inside the Treasury doorway - unlike the scene in Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade, when Indy finds stone lions and Crusader seals set into the floor - 
there's only a blank square chamber, with smaller rooms opening off it, the 
entrance portico flanked by rooms featuring unusual round windows above 
their doors. Access to the interior is barred, but you can poke your nose in. The 
function of the Treasury is unknown, but a significant clue is the recessed basin
on its threshold with a channel leading outside, clearly for libations or ritual 
washing. None of Petra's tomb-monuments has this feature, but the High Place 
of Sacrifice does, suggesting that the Treasury may have been a place of worship, 
possibly a tomb-temple.
The Outer Siq
From the Wadi al-Jarra, the path - known here as the Outer Siq - broadens 
and is lined with tombs in varying states of erosion. Steps lead up to a large 
cavern on the right, lined with benches inside and rather smelly. Opposite is 
a line of tombs at different heights, showing how the wadi floor rose during 
Nabatean occupation of Petra; most are badly eroded. One has the crow-step 
PETRA | Petra: The approach to the city

288
ornamental design that originated in Assyria and was adapted by the 
Nabateans to reappear in dozens of Petra's facades: a band of rising and falling 
zigzags running horizontally across the top of the facade. As the path 
broadens, in the corner of the right-hand cliff - pointed to by the terracotta 
pipe that has emerged from the Siq - the Tomb of 17 Graves is being 
restored behind scaffolding. If you look up and to the left of it, you'll spot 
Petra colours
One of the most breathtaking aspects of Petra - for many people surpassing even 
the architecture - is its colourful sandstone, famously celebrated in a particular 
tourist's memoirs almost 150 years ago. As the artist Edward Lear strolled up the 
Colonnaded Street on a visit in 1858, coolly noting "the tint of the stone... brilliant 
and gay beyond my anticipation", his manservant and cook, Giorgio Kokali, burst out 
in delight, "Oh master, we have come into a world of chocolate, ham, curry powder 
and salmon!" Agatha Christie preferred to see the rocks as "blood-red", and a 
character in her Appointment with Death, set in Petra, comes out with a line 
describing the place as "very much the colour of raw beef".
Unfortunately for posterity, however, the most famous lines on Petra's colours are 
less engaging. In 1845, John William Burgon, later to become Dean of Chichester, 
wrote in his poem Petra:
It seems no work of Man's creative hand,
By labour wrought as wavering fancy planned;
But from the rock as if by magic grown,
Eternal, silent, beautiful, alone!
Not virgin-white like that old Doric shrine,
Where erst Athena held her rites divine;
Not saintly-grey, like many a minister fane,
That crowns the hill and consecrates the plain;
But rose-red as if the blush of dawn
That ﬁrst beheld them were not yet withdrawn;
The hues of youth upon a brow of woe,
Which Man deemed old two thousand years ago,
Match me such a marvel save in Eastern clime,
A rose-red city half as old as Time.
No advertising copywriter could have dreamt up a better ﬁnal line, and Burgon's 
words have hung over Petra ever since: you'll be sick of reading "rose-red city" on 
every map, poster and booklet by the time you leave. Tellingly, Burgon had never 
been to Petra when he wrote it; he ﬁnally went sixteen years later, and at least then 
had the humility to write, if only in a letter to his sister, "there is nothing rosy about 
Petra".
Over the centuries, wind has rubbed away at the soft sandstone of Petra's cliffs to 
reveal an extraordinary array of colours streaking through the stone. The most 
colourful facades in Petra are the Silk Tomb and the Carmine Tomb, both on the 
East Cliff and bedecked in bands of rainbow colours, while the cafés on the path 
below are set in caves no less breathtaking. Elsewhere, the lower walls of the Wadi 
Farasa are streaked with colour, and the Siq cliffs are striped with everything from 
scarlet to yellow to purple to brown, to complement the green foliage on the trees, 
the pink of the oleander ﬂowers, and the deep blue sky. The one place in Petra that's 
truly "rose-red" is the Treasury, lit in the afternoons by low reﬂected sunlight off the 
pinkish walls.
PETRA | Petra: The approach to the city

289
one of the clearest examples of Nabatean facade-building; the Tomb of 
Unayshu (see p.292) presents a sharp profile of a clean classical facade facing 
left, carved from a rough outcrop of rock behind that looks barely capable of 
supporting it.
The path then opens out to the left to expose the Street of Facades, an 
agglomeration of dozens of facades carved side by side out of the rock on at 
least four different levels. Most are simple, cornice-free designs, probably some 
of the earliest carving in Petra. It's around here that you'll come across the first 
of Petra's many cafés, all of which offer water, shade and soft drinks.
The theatre
A few metres ahead sits Petra's massive theatre. Obviously classical in design 
and inspiration, it's nonetheless been dated to the first century AD, before the 
Romans annexed Nabatea but at a time when links between the two powers 
must have been strong. Though the Romans refurbished the building after they 
took over in 106, the basic design was still Hellenistic, with seats coming right 
down to the orchestra's floor level. As many as 8500 people could be accom-
modated, more even than in the vast theatre at Amman. Aside from the stage 
backdrop and the ends of the banks of seating, the entire edifice was carved out 
of the mountainside; one whole street of facades was wiped out to form the 
back wall of the auditorium, leaving some of their interiors behind as incon-
gruous gaps. Much renovation work has been done here in recent years, in 
particular to build up the stage area, with its niches in front and elaborate scaenae
frons behind (tumbled in the earthquake of 363), the high back wall of which 
would have sealed off the theatre from the street outside.
The path continues past cafés on both sides down to a point at which the 
Wadi Musa turns sharp left (west) into the city centre (see p.295). Way up to 
the right, a row of some of Petra's grandest monuments has been etched into 
the East Cliff (see p.292), while straight ahead the valley opens up towards 
Baydha, with the Wadi Mataha (see p.310) coming in from the northeast.
PETRA | Petra: The High Place of Sacrifice route
The account of the main path through Petra continues on p.295.
The High Place of Sacriﬁce route
A little before you reach the theatre, a set of steps leading south up a rocky 
slope to one side of a deep valley gives access to the High Place of 
Sacrifice, a diversion off the main path, but an unmissable part of a visit. Even 
if you have only one day in Petra, this is still worth the climb, about thirty or 
forty minutes with safe steps at all tricky points - there's no scrambling or 
mountaineering involved. You can return the same way, but steps also lead 
down off the back of the mountain into Wadi Farasa, forming a long but 
interesting loop that delivers you (after about two and a half hours) to the 
Qasr al-Bint. The breathtaking views and some of Petra's most extraordinary 
rock-colouring make the hike worthwhile, quite apart from the wealth of 
Nabatean architecture at every turn and the dramatic High Place itself. The 
path is well travelled, and you're unlikely to find yourself alone for more than 
a few minutes at a time.

290
The route up from the Outer Siq
The steps up are clearly marked, guarded by several god-blocks, and wind their 
way into the deep cleft of the beautiful Wadi al-Mahfur; at several points, the 
Nabatean engineers took their chisels to what were otherwise impassable 
outcrops and sliced deep-cut corridors through the rock to house the stairs. The 
sign that you're reaching the top, apart from one or two impromptu cafés 
beneath bamboo shelters, is the appearance on your left of two very prominent 
obelisks, both over 6m high. As in the Bab as-Siq and elsewhere, these probably 
represent the chief male and female Nabatean deities, Dushara and al-Uzza, 
although far more extraordinary is to realize that they are solid: instead of being 
placed there, this entire side of the mountain-top was instead levelled to leave 
them sticking up. The ridge on which they stand is still marked on modern 
maps with the bedouin name of Zibb Attuf, the Phallus of Mercy (often 
adapted to Amud Attuf, the Column of Mercy), implying that the notion of 
these obelisks representing beneficial fertility was somehow passed down 
unchanged from the Nabateans to the modern age. Opposite stand very ruined 
walls, the last remnants of what could have been a Crusader fort or a Nabatean 
structure. Broken steps lead beside it up to the summit.
The High Place of Sacriﬁce
As you emerge onto the hand-levelled platform atop the ridge, the sense of 
exposure after the climb is suddenly liberating. The High Place of Sacrifice
(al-Madhbah in Arabic) is one of the highest easily accessible points in Petra, 
perched on cliffs that drop an almost sheer 170m to the Wadi Musa below. It's 
just one of dozens of High Places perched on ridges and mountain-tops around 
Petra, all of which are of similar design and function. A platform about 15m 
long and 6m wide served as the venue for the religious ceremonies, oriented 
towards an altar, set up on four steps, with a basin to one side and a socket into 
which may have slotted a stone representation of the god. Within the courtyard 
is a small dais, on which probably stood a table of (bloodless) offerings.
What exactly took place up here - probably in honour of Dushara - can only 
be guessed at, but there were almost certainly libations, smoking of frankincense 
and animal sacrifice. What is less sure is whether human sacrifice took place, 
although boys and girls were known to have been sacrificed to al-Uzza 
elsewhere: the second-century philosopher Porphyrius reports that a boy's 
throat was cut annually at the Nabatean town of Dunat, 300km from Petra. At 
Hegra, a Nabatean city in the Arabian interior, an inscription states explicitly: 
"Abd-Wadd, priest of Wadd, and his son Salim... have consecrated the young 
man Salim to be immolated to Dhu Gabat. Their double happiness!" If such 
sacrifices took place in Petra, the High Place would surely have seen at least 
some of them. It's also been suggested that Nabatean religion incorporated 
ritual exposure of the dead, as practised among the Zoroastrians of Persia; if 
so, the High Place would also have been an obvious choice as an exposure 
platform. You can survey the vastness of Petra's mountain terrain from here, and 
the tomb of Aaron atop Jebel Haroun is in clear sight in the distance.
The ridge extends a short distance north of the High Place, nosing out 
directly above the theatre, with the tombs of the Outer Siq minuscule below. 
From here, it's easy to see that the city of Petra lay in a broad valley, about a 
kilometre wide and hemmed in to east and west by mountain barriers; north 
the valley extends to Baydha, south to Sabra. It looks tempting to scramble 
down the front of the ridge, but there is no easily manageable path this way; it 
would be dangerous to try it.
PETRA | Petra: The High Place of Sacrifice route

291
The route down via Wadi Farasa
It's easy to go back the way you came, but the route down the western cliff of 
the Attuf ridge via Wadi Farasa ("Butterfly Valley") is far preferable. The route 
leads directly straight ahead (south) as you scramble down from the High Place 
past the ruined Crusader walls, keeping the bamboo café on your right. After 
50m you'll come to stairs winding downward to your right along the valley 
wall; the way is often narrow and steep but always clear. Note that it's also 
possible to descend via Wadi Nmayr, parallel to Wadi Farasa, but this is a very 
difficult, concealed path and should only be attempted with a knowledgeable 
guide.
The Lion Monument and Garden Triclinium
Part of the way down into the Wadi Farasa you'll come to the Lion Monument
carved into a wall. This may have been a drinking fountain, since a pipe seems 
to have fed water to emerge from the lion's mouth. The creature itself, as on the 
Treasury facade, represented al-Uzza, and the monument was probably intended 
both to refresh devotees on their way up and prepare them for the ceremonies 
about to be held at the High Place. The precipitous stairs beyond, which give 
views of the monuments below, bring you down to the Garden Triclinium, a 
simple monument overlooked by a huge tree in a beautiful, hidden setting, 
which got its name from the carpet of green that sprouts in springtime in front 
of the portico. Two freestanding columns are framed by two engaged ones; 
within is a small square shrine. Stairs to the right of the facade lead to a huge 
cistern on the roof, serving the Roman Soldier Tomb below.
The Roman Soldier Tomb and around
A beautiful set of rock-cut stairs to the left of the Garden Triclinium brings 
you down to the complex of the Roman Soldier Tomb. Although not 
immediately apparent, the two facades facing each other across the wadi 
formed part of a unified area, with an elaborate colonnaded courtyard and 
garden between them, long vanished. The tomb itself is on your left, a 
classical facade with three framed niches holding figures probably repre-
senting those buried within; the interior chamber has a number of recesses 
for the dead. Opposite the tomb, with an eroded but undecorated facade, is 
a startlingly colourful triclinium, unique in Petra for having a carved 
interior. The walls have been decorated with fluted columns and bays, all 
worn to show streaks of mauves, blues, pinks, crimsons and silver. Why this 
triclinium was decorated so carefully, and who was buried in the tomb 
opposite, isn't known; even the name is only a supposition from the middle 
of the tomb's three figures, a headless man wearing a cuirass.
Stairs lead down over the lip of a retaining wall to the wadi floor, and it is 
around here that the colouring in the rock is at its most gorgeous. Plenty of 
tombs crowd the lower reaches of the wadi; one of the most interesting is the 
Renaissance Tomb, topped by an urn and with an unusual arch above its 
doorway also carrying three urns. Nearby is the Broken Pediment Tomb, 
above the level of the path, displaying an early forerunner of the kind of broken 
pediment found on Petra's grandest monuments, the Treasury and the 
Monastery.
Zantur, Katuteh and Amud Faraoun
As you emerge from the wadi into the open, you should bear in mind that 
you're still the best part of half an hour from reaching the main routes again. 
From here onwards, though, there's not a scrap of shade and you're quite often 
PETRA | Petra: The High Place of Sacrifice route

292
walking in stifling breezeless dips between hills. In addition, the path isn't 
immediately clear. You should bear a little right, initially keeping out of the wadi 
bed, and aim for the left flank of the smooth rounded hill dead ahead. This hill 
is Zantur, Petra's rubbish dump, and it crunches underfoot with fragments of 
pottery: as well as coarse, crudely decorated modern shards, there are countless 
chips of beautiful original Nabatean ware - very thin, smooth pottery that's 
been skilfully painted. As long as you don't start digging, you can take whatever 
you like.
Within metres are the remains of the house of a wealthy Nabatean merchant 
at Katuteh, suddenly abandoned for some reason (possibly, archeologists 
theorize, as a result of having the city's garbage dumped in the back garden). 
Swiss teams are currently excavating the villa.
The path eventually curls around to the western flank of the hill and Amud 
Faraoun, called Zibb Faraoun ("Pharaoh's Phallus") by the bedouin. This 
standing column, which must have formed part of the portico of a building - 
part-visible buried in the rubbly hill behind - now serves as a useful landmark 
and resting spot. Paths converge here from all sides; to the southwest is the 
main route into Wadi Thughra towards Umm al-Biyara, Jebel Haroun and Sabra; 
to the west is a path accessing a route up al-Habees; to the northwest are the 
Qasr al-Bint (see p.301) and the tent cafés; and to the northeast a path runs 
behind the markets area of the city centre (see p.300), parallel to the Colon-
naded Street.
The East Cliff
About 250m beyond the theatre, just before the Wadi Musa makes its sharp left 
turn, solid, modern steps lead to the East Cliff, looming up to the right above 
the city centre. This whole elbow of Jebel al-Khubtha is ranged with some of 
Petra's most impressive facades, collectively known as the Royal Tombs. If you 
have anything more than half a day in the city, you should fit them in; the climb 
is easy and the views are marvellous. From down below, in the direct, reddish 
light of late afternoon, the entire cliff seems to glow with an inner translucence, 
and is one of the sights of Petra. However, it's probably best to aim to be up 
here in the morning shadows, with the sun lighting up the valley and the 
mountains opposite.
From right to left, the first tomb on the cliff - separate from the big ones, and 
missable if you're short of time - is the Tomb of Unayshu, viewed in profile 
from the Outer Siq and easiest to get to by scrambling up the rocks opposite the 
High Place staircase. This is part of a complete Nabatean tomb complex, and 
features a once-porticoed courtyard in front, with a triclinium to one side.
The Urn Tomb
Heading north from Unayshu above the main path, past another well-
preserved tomb facade, you join the modern steps leading from below up to 
the soaring facade of the Urn Tomb, with its very large colonnaded forecourt 
partially supported on several storeys of arched vaults. The Bdul know the 
tomb as Al-Mahkamah, "the Court", dubbing the vaults As-Sijin, "the Jail". 
Whether it was later used in this way or not, the whole structure would seem 
originally to have been the tomb of somebody extremely important, quite 
probably one of the Nabatean kings - but who exactly isn't known. Set into 
the facade high above the forecourt between the engaged columns are spaces 
for three bodies; this is a unique configuration in Petra, since such loculi are

normally inside the monument, and they seem to have been placed here as an 
indication of the importance of their occupants. The central one - possibly 
that of the king himself - is still partially sealed by a stone which formerly 
depicted the bust of a man wearing a toga. The urn which gave the tomb its 
name is at the very top.
Due, no doubt, to its dominating position in the city's landscape, the tomb was 
later converted into a major church, possibly Petra's cathedral; the large 
The bedouin named for changing
From time immemorial, the caves and dens of Petra have been occupied by one of 
Jordan's poorest and most downtrodden tribes, the Bdul. Surrounded by tribes living 
traditional tent-based lifestyles (the Saidiyeen to the south and west, the Ammareen
to the north, and the Liyathneh to the east), the Bdul remain a community apart, 
looked down upon for their poverty, small numbers (only about three hundred 
families) and cave-centred lifestyle.
Most bedouin tribes can trace their lineage back to a single founding father 
(whether real or ﬁctitious), but mystery surrounds the origin of the Bdul. Some Bdul, 
naturally enough, claim descent from the Nabateans, but this may just be wishful 
thinking. Most claim that the name Bdul derives from the Arabic word badal, meaning 
to swap or change, and was given to the tribe after the survivors of a massacre at 
the hands of Moses and the Israelites had agreed to convert to Judaism; at some 
point in the centuries following, the tribe converted again, this time to Islam. Much 
more plausible is the possibility that the Bdul earned their name from being a 
nomadic tribe that decided to settle in the ruins of Petra, changing their habits to suit 
a more stable existence.
The Bdul were slow to beneﬁt from the growth in tourism in Petra, largely because 
of cut-throat competition with the more cosmopolitan and better-educated Liyathneh 
of Wadi Musa. When the Resthouse opened in the 1950s, Liyathneh were hired as 
construction workers, hotel staff, book- and postcard-sellers and even to provide 
horses for rides into Petra; their near-monopoly on tourist facilities in Wadi Musa has 
persisted to this day. Adding insult to injury, a USAID report dating from the establish-
ment of Petra as a National Park in 1968 acknowledged that the Bdul held traditional 
rights over park lands, but nonetheless recommended that they be resettled
elsewhere. This sparked a ﬁfteen-year battle to oust the Bdul from Petra, which saw 
the tribe's traditional lifestyle of agriculture and goatherding decimated, income 
instead dribbling in from the refreshment cafés within Petra and the few individuals 
offering crafts and antiquities - real and fake - to tourists. In the mid-1980s, tempted 
by material comforts in the new, purpose-built village of Umm Sayhoun, many Bdul 
families ﬁnally left the caves of Petra for the breezeblock houses on the ridge. Some 
still herd a few goats, others cultivate small plots, but most Bdul are refocusing their 
energies on making an income providing services to tourists. You'll meet Bdul adults 
and kids in all corners of Petra, running the tent cafés or offering tea and trinkets in 
the hills, and often happy to chat (in surprisingly ﬂuent English). The "bedouin named 
for changing", as archeologist Kenneth Russell dubbed them, are embracing change 
yet again.

.acacialand.com - and also see Ruth Caswell's pages about the tribes of Wadi Musa 
at Wwww.jordanjubilee.com. The best modern account of Bdul life in Petra is 
Married to a Bedouin (Wwww.marriedtoabedouin.com; see also p.400), a book by 
New Zealander Marguerite van Geldermalsen, who came to Petra on holiday in 1978, 
fell in love with a local souvenir-seller and stayed to marry him and raise a family. 
Marguerite still lives in Petra, running a souvenir stall in the site and occasionally 
leading tours. She welcomes visitors (by appointment) - see her website for details.

interior room features, near the left-hand corner of the back wall, a Greek 
inscription in red paint recording the dedication of the church by Bishop Jason 
in 447 AD. Probably at the same time, two central recesses of the original four 
were combined to make a kind of apse, and myriad holes were drilled in the 
floor to support all the relevant ecclesiastical furniture: chancel screens, a pulpit, 
maybe a table, and so on. The view from the forecourt, which takes in the full 
sweep of the valley (and even the urn atop the Monastery), is one of Petra's best.
The Silk Tomb, Corinthian Tomb and Palace Tomb
Working your way around the cliff, you'll come to the Silk Tomb, unremark-
able but for its brilliant colouring. The facade of the nearby Corinthian Tomb
is something like a hybrid and ramshackle Treasury. It has the Treasury's style on 
 The Urn Tomb, Petra
PETRA | Petra: The East Cliff

295
the upper level - a tholos flanked by a broken pediment - but below, it's a mess, 
the symmetry thrown out by extra doors on the left. It has also suffered badly 
at the hands of the wind. However, such an exposed position on the corner of 
the cliff - directly in line with the Colonnaded Street - points to the fact that, 
like the Urn Tomb, this may well have been the tomb of another Nabatean king, 
visible from everywhere in the city.
Adjacent is an even more ramshackle jumble, the very broad Palace Tomb, 
boasting one of Petra's largest facades. There are at least five different storeys, the 
top portions of which were built of masonry because the cliff turned out to be 
too low, and so subsequently collapsed. The unevenly spaced line of engaged 
columns on the second row clashes nastily with the orthodox lower level. 
Protected by the cliff, the extreme right-hand edge of the facade still has some 
sharply carved detail surviving.
The Sextius Florentinus Tomb, Carmine Tomb and the 
Khubtha High Places
From the Palace Tomb, tracks lead west towards the city centre, and northeast 
hugging the cliff round to the peaceful Sextius Florentinus Tomb, positioned 
facing north where a finger of the cliff reaches the ground. Sextius Florentinus was 
a Roman governor of the Province of Arabia who died about 130 AD, and must 
have chosen to be buried in Petra rather than in the provincial capital of Bosra. The 
facade of his tomb, with a graceful semicircular pediment, is one of the most 
pleasing in the city. A few metres north, behind a tree, is the spectacular Carmine 
Tomb, girt with breathtaking bands of colour, but, by virtue of its position, hardly 
ever noticed. Wadi Zarnug al-Khubtha, which divides the two, holds a path which 
gives reasonably easy, if steep, access to little-visited High Places and a few scattered 
ruins perched atop the massive Jebel al-Khubtha, the main barrier standing 
between Petra and Wadi Musa town. The views from on top are tremendous - 
especially of the theatre - but you'd have to be keen (and sure-footed) to try it.
The path beyond Sextius Florentinus along the Wadi Mataha is described 
on p.310.
The city centre
As you round the corner of the path leading from the theatre, the city centre
of Petra, focused along the Cardo Maximus, or Colonnaded Street, stretches 
out ahead, framed by the barrier range of mountains - and the flat-topped giant 
Umm al-Biyara - behind. Although there are excavations continuing on the flat, 
rounded hills to either side, the overall impression is of rocky desolation; 
however, in Petra's prime, the landscape in all directions was covered with 
buildings - houses big and small, temples, marketplaces - all of them long since 
collapsed. Many archeologists theorize that much of Petra is in fact still hidden 
beneath the dusty soil, and that all the facades and what few buildings have so 
far been exposed are the tip of the iceberg.
Until you reach the Temenos at the far end of the Colonnaded Street, the 
only monument actually on the street is the Nymphaeum, although both the 
northern (right-hand) and southern (left-hand) slopes hold plenty of interest. 
Petra's main museum, the Basin Museum, lies just beyond the Temenos. 
Looming over the city centre from the west is a pinnacle of rock known as Al-
Habees, separate from the huge mountains behind and featuring, partway up, 
another small museum and - on the summit - a crumbling Crusader fort and 
some of the best views in all of Petra.
PETRA | Petra: The city centre

296
The Nymphaeum
One of the few trees in the city centre - a huge, lush pistachio - stands proudly 
over the ruined Nymphaeum, these days more popular as a shady hangout for 
the bedouin police than anything else. Virtually nothing remains of the ancient 
superstructure, and even the retaining wall is modern. However, its location is 
key, at the confluence of the Wadi Musa, flowing from east to west, and the Wadi 
Mataha, bringing the water diverted by the dam at the Siq entrance into the 
city from the northeast. It may also have been the terminus for the terracotta 
pipes and channels bringing water through the Siq itself. The sight and sound

of water splashing freely from such a monument must have been wonderful in 
such a parched city centre.
The Nymphaeum is where you'll end up if you've walked the Wadi Muthlim 
route from the dam (see p.285); it's equally possible to walk the route in 
reverse, although the initial stretch will be down in the wadi bed, and less 
appealing than following the East Cliff around to join Wadi Mataha further 
north (see p.310). You should allow a minimum of two and a half tough hours 
- preferably three - from the Nymphaeum to circumambulate Jebel Khubtha 
and get back to the gate.
The northern slopes
The northern slopes - formally dubbed Jebel Qabr Jumayan - that rise to the 
right as you look along the Colonnaded Street from the Nymphaeum, host the 
stunning Petra Church mosaics and a clutch of smaller Byzantine sites on the 
hills above, as well as one of the city's longest-standing excavations, the Temple 
of the Winged Lions.
The Petra Church
Above and behind the Nymphaeum stands a modern shelter protecting the 
Byzantine Petra Church, as it's been unimaginatively dubbed. This is a large 
tripartite basilica, roughly 26m by 15m, with three apses to the east and three 
entrances to the west, accessed from a stone-paved atrium. It was built in the 
late fifth century, and remodelled about fifty years later. Around 600 it was 
burned, and remained derelict until earthquakes shook it down shortly after-
wards. Surviving in both aisles of the church, though, are superbly detailed floor
mosaics depicting the bounty of creation, dated stylistically to the early sixth 
century. Much of the stone used to build the church was pilfered from the 
ruined Nabatean and Roman monuments all around, and now lies tumbled 
down the slopes in front.
The spectacular south-aisle mosaics are in three rows, the central line of 
personifications of the seasons flanked by rows of animals, birds and fish. From 
door to altar, the middle line features fishermen and hunters interspersed with 
Ocean (with one foot on a fish), a delightfully clear-faced Spring, and Summer 
with her breast bared and holding a fish. The north-aisle mosaics depict
people and indigenous and exotic animals and birds, including a camel-like 
giraffe, a hyena, boar, bear and leopard. Archeologists also found thousands of 
gilded glass tesserae, indicating that lavish wall mosaics once adorned the 
Images of Nabatean Petra
It is often very difﬁcult to grasp what Petra must have looked like in its Nabatean 
"golden age", when it was an extravagantly wealthy city, home to tens of 
thousands of people. Grand temples and public buildings - which, today, are 
rubbly excavation sites - stood to their full height, watercourses ﬂowed to irrigate 
lush gardens in what looks now like dusty waste-ground and the natural earth 
tones were tempered with brightly coloured plasterwork adorning many of the 
buildings. Many architects and artists have tried to depict Petra's ancient reality, 
with varying degrees of accuracy. One in particular - Chrysanthos Kanello-
poulos, an archeologist in his own right - has worked over many years with a 
number of teams in Petra and around Jordan. His scrupulously accurate, 
pin-sharp renderings of what Petra would have looked like two thousand years 
ago are stunning. Google his name to ﬁnd them.

church, and they managed to reconstruct - from more than a hundred pieces - 
a huge marble tub with panthers for handles (which is now in the Basin 
Museum). At the rear (west) of the atrium is a superbly well-preserved fifth-
century Baptistry, with a cruciform font surrounded by four limestone 
columns. The presence of such a large church so richly decorated - and the 
discovery of the Petra scrolls - merely highlights how little is known about 
Byzantine Petra, and how much awaits discovery.
From in front of the Petra Church, great views extend over the valley. To the 
left is the East Cliff; ahead is the Great Temple; and to the right you can clearly 
see the unusual Unfinished Tomb (see p.302), carved into the base of Al-Habees.
The Blue Church and Ridge Church
On a ridge just above the Petra Church is the Blue Church, so named for its 
bluish granite columns. Not a great deal is known about this building, and work 
is ongoing. A short climb to the top of the hill that peaks behind the Petra 
Church will bring you to the austere Ridge Church, a much smaller building 
(some 18m by 13m) perched on a ridge at the northwestern edge of Byzantine-
era Petra, overlooking the Wadi Turkmaniyyeh behind and the whole of the city 
centre in front. Dated to roughly the same time as the Petra Church, much of 
the church's interior paving survives, but there's no decoration. What's most 
interesting about the place is that archeologists found almost no remnants of the 
building's superstructure nearby, although they did find a hoard of water-
washed stones in the church courtyard brought up from the wadi below. From 
this confusing evidence, they came up with an elaborate theory for the church's 
destruction. At a time of increasing political instability, they postulate, the 
 Byzantine mosaic, Petra Church
PETRA | Petra: The city centre

299
Petrans deliberately dismantled the church - which lay hard up against the city 
wall - in order to use its stones as missiles against invaders approaching from 
below. When the church had been razed, they collected more stones from the 
wadi to hoard against future attacks, but these were forgotten as, possibly, the 
city was overrun from a different direction. Any truth in this tale has yet to be 
confirmed.
The Temple of the Winged Lions
Overlooking the Temenos Gate west of the Petra Church is the Temple of 
the Winged Lions, the principal building of the northern slope. It was 
named for unusual column capitals featuring winged lions (one of which is in 
the Basin Museum), but would - so the excavator suggests - have been more 
appropriately named the Temple of al-Uzza, for it seems to have been 
dedicated to her. Dated approximately to the early first century AD, the 
building was approached via a bridge across the Wadi Musa, parts of which 
you can still see on the banks. Worshippers would have proceeded across 
ascending terraces, an open colonnaded courtyard and a portico into the 
temple itself, featuring close-packed columns and an altar platform. The floors 
were paved in contrasting black, brown and white marble, and the walls 
decorated with painted plaster; archeologists uncovered both a painter's 
workshop - with paints and pigments still in their ceramic pots - and a 
marble-cutter's workshop adjoining the temple.
One of the most spectacular discoveries, also now on display in the Basin 
Museum, was a small rectangular stone idol, complete with a stylized face and 
The Petra scrolls
A hugely signiﬁcant archeological ﬁnd was made by accident in a storage room at 
the northeast corner of the Petra Church on December 4, 1993: archeologists 
stumbled on a cache of 152 papyrus scrolls, tumbled higgledy-piggledy from the 
shelves that presumably once carried them, which had lain buried beneath 4m of 
rubble. Analysis of the scrolls is still incomplete, but they have given tantalizing 
glimpses of life in Byzantine Petra, a period that is rarely accounted for.
The whole archive seems to have belonged to one Theodore, born in 514, who at 
the age of 24 married a young woman from a family already connected with his own 
by marriage in a previous generation. Theodore became archdeacon of the "Most 
Holy Church of NN in the metropolis" - presumably the Petra Church. Most of the 
documents date from a sixty-year period, roughly 528 to 588, and comprise property 
contracts, out-of-court settlements and tax receipts, providing a wealth of detail 
about everyday life. Transfers from one family to another of vineyards, arable land, 
orchards, living quarters and stables within a ﬁfty-kilometre radius of Petra were all 
dutifully recorded. One man's will speciﬁes that after his mother's death, all her 
assets were to be donated to the "House of Aron", the Byzantine monastery atop 
Jebel Haroun. Farmers, tailors, doctors, slaves and soldiers are all mentioned by 
name, including one Abu Karib ibn Jabala, known to have been a military commander 
of the Arab tribes. However, Petra was decisively Christian at this time, and monks 
and priests feature prominently, not least a Bishop Theodore, who may have been the 
same Theodore who took part in a synod at Jerusalem in 536. Another reference is 
to a priest "of her, our All-Holy, Praised Lady, the Glorious God-Bearing and Eternally 
Virgin Mary", indicating that there may be a church to Mary yet to be uncovered in 
Petra. Only once the content of the scrolls has been fully published can investigation 
proceed any further, but this is just another sign that archeologists have only just 
begun to scratch Petra's surface.

a hole between the eyes (possibly for a set of horns, the symbol of the goddess 
Isis, to be inserted); the inscription along the base reads "Goddess of Hayyan son 
of Nybat". Adjacent to the temple to the east is a large unexcavated area of 
rubble deemed to have been a royal palace, also with a bridge over the wadi, 
but no work has as yet been done on it.
The southern slopes
From the Nymphaeum all the way along the paved Colonnaded Street 
westwards, columns on your left (south) stand in front of what have been 
dubbed Petra's markets. Alongside the Great Temple further along is the 
Garden Terrace, once a fertile, leafy area flowing with water. Ranged along 
street level in front of the markets, to either side of the grand staircases, were 
small shops, which may have been refitted in the Byzantine period; some have 
been renovated, but work to excavate the market floors and outbuildings 
remains ongoing.
The Garden Terrace
Although there's not a great deal of above-ground evidence, the area alongside 
the Great Temple has been identified as an area of ornamental gardens, dubbed 
the Garden Terrace. This was laid out in Petra's "golden age" - the late first 
century BC - as a place of refuge in the city centre, tucked in amongst the 
grand temples and busy shops all around. In front, nearest the street, was a flat 
area that comprised the gardens themselves. Behind, occupying the whole 
southern area of the terrace, was a large pool, 43m long by 23m wide (and 
about two and a half metres deep), surrounded by a colonnade. Occupying an 
island in the centre of the pool was a small, rectangular pavilion. The beauty of 
such a site can only be imagined.
The Great Temple
Alongside the Garden Terrace at the western end of the street, and accessed by 
a set of steps leading up from the street, is the late first-century BC Great 
Temple, or Southern Temple, an extremely grand affair, one of the largest 
complexes in the city at seven thousand square metres. Excavation work by US 
teams remains ongoing.
Worshippers originally climbed a staircase from street level through a now 
tumbled monumental gateway onto the hexagonally paved lower temenos, 
featuring triple colonnades to east and west culminating in semicircular 
benched alcoves. The temple itself stands some 25m above street level, fronted 
by four enormous columns which were originally stuccoed in red and white. 
Within the cella stands a renovated Nabatean theatre, or theatron, about 7m 
in diameter, which would have seated at least three hundred people, and might 
have been a council chamber. The whole building is extremely complex, set 
on different levels, with internal and external corridors flanking it on east and 
west. In addition, tumbled columns and chunks of architectural elements 
(many of them beautifully carved) all point to the fact that this was one of 
Petra's most important monuments. As yet, though, not even the deity who was 
worshipped here is known.
Scramble to the highest point of the walls for views west to the arches of the 
Crusader fort atop Al-Habees, north across the wadi to the Temple of the 
Winged Lions, behind which lie the valley tombs of Wadi Muaysreh ash-Shargi-
yyeh, and northeast to the Petra Church, with Umm Sayhoun behind it and 
Mughur an-Nassara to one side.
PETRA | Petra: The city centre

301
The Temenos
In most Roman cities, the main east-west and north-south streets ploughed 
straight furrows from city gate to city gate. However, as at Bosra, the heterodox 
Nabateans blocked off Petra's main street at one end and turned the area beyond 
- hard up against the mountain cliffs - into a Temenos, or sacred temple 
precinct. Framing the western end of the Colonnaded Street stand the partially 
reconstructed remains of the Temenos Gate, marking the end of the commer-
cial sector of Petra and the entrance to the main area of worship. Sockets in the 
threshold indicate that great doors once closed off all three entrances of the 
gate; the floral frieze which survives on the easternmost facade of the gate was 
originally framed by freestanding columns which stood just in front and to 
either side.
As you pass through the gate, the impression remains of having left the city 
behind; the courtyard - occupied at the far end by, on one side, camels and, on 
the other, the bulk of a temple - is huge, paved and open, and at times of 
religious celebration would have been thronged with people. Low walls 
enclosed the Temenos on both sides, although the northern one has been 
eroded away by the waters of the Wadi Musa. Just inside the Temenos Gate to 
the south are three domed rooms tentatively identified as baths, only partially 
excavated. All along the south wall is a double row of stone benches, some 73m 
in length, leading almost up to the main feature of the Temenos, the Qasr 
al-Bint, the only freestanding monument as yet uncovered in the whole of 
Petra. Just visible from the Temenos, over the hill to the south, is the tip of the 
Amud Faraoun (see p.292).
The Qasr al-Bint
The Qasr al-Bint al-Faraoun ("Palace of Pharaoh's Daughter") is nothing of 
the sort. Its name derives from another far-fetched bedouin tale of the pharaoh, 
who, it's said, after stashing his riches in the Treasury, and still desperate to let 
nothing slow him down in his pursuit of the Israelites, stashed his daughter away 
here for safekeeping. Interestingly enough though, an inscription naming 
Suudat, daughter of the Nabatean king Malchus II (40-70 AD), and probably 
from the base of a statue, was found on the steps; according to historian Iain 
Browning, this indicates that some link between the qasr and the daughter of a 
powerful man may not be so fanciful after all.
The building is a huge, square Nabatean temple, dating from the late first 
century BC, oriented to the north and facing a huge, freestanding altar, some 
13m by 12m and at least 3m high. The altar, clad in marble, showed a blank 
wall to the north, and was originally approached by steps from in front of the 
temple. From here looking back, the four gigantic columns of the temple 
portico, standing at the head of a broad staircase wider than the building and 
topped by an architrave and pediment, would have made a deeply impressive 
sight. The huge arch that survives today was probably only a relieving arch 
for a lower, horizontal lintel of the doorway into the cella, which spanned the 
width of the building and was lit by windows high up in each wall. Behind, 
the holy of holies was divided into three separate chambers, or adyta. The 
central one is slightly raised, and has engaged columns along the walls and 
another relieving arch overhead; this is where the god-block or cult statue 
would have stood. The temple's dedication is unknown, but Dushara is the 
most obvious candidate.
Tent cafés and camel drivers crowd the courtyard in front of the Qasr 
al-Bint, and this is the main rest area for gathering strength before you 
continue to explore or start the long walk back to the gate (which takes a full

hour uphill by the most direct route through the Siq). In front of the qasr, a 
bridge crosses the Wadi Musa to the Basin Restaurant and museum; from the 
other bank, the Wadi Turkmaniyyeh dirt road (see p.309) wends its way out 
of the city to Umm Sayhoun.
The Basin Museum
Shaded by a prominent grove of trees opposite the Qasr al-Bint is the Basin 
Restaurant (see p.276) and adjacent Basin Museum (daily 8am-3.30pm; 
free). The latter is definitely worth a quick look if only to give yourself a 
break from all the imposing architecture. It holds excellent informative 
noticeboards on Petra's history and geography (including a fascinating 
digression into the frankincense trade), as well as information about the 
Nabateans. Plenty of finds are on display from all periods of occupation at 
Petra, stretching right back to Neolithic times, among which Nabatean coins, 
pottery and some beautiful and delicate jewellery are the most engaging. 
Specific pieces that stand out are the idol from the Temple of the Winged 
Lions, statues of Aphrodite and Dionysus, and the massive panther-handled 
marble tub from the Petra Church.
Al-Habees
The modern building next to the Qasr al-Bint - now used by the Depart-
ment of Antiquities - is known as Nazzal's Camp, and was formerly Petra's 
sole hotel (of eleven rooms), built by the Nazzal family in 1943 on the site 
of Thomas Cook's old three-bed campsite established nine years before. 
Early Cook's tourists were offered the option of sleeping instead in one of 
the caves cut into Al-Habees looming overhead. These caves are used now 
as storage areas and offices for the police, but one has been converted into 
a small museum (daily except Tues 8am-3.30pm, sometimes closed Fri; 
free), accessed up stairs in front of Nazzal's Camp and well worth a look. 
The chamber is crammed full of marvellous statuary, including busts of 
various Roman gods, an eagle with outspread wings perched on a thunder-
bolt (symbol of Zeus), and a headless statue of Hercules recovered from 
the theatre.
From the museum it's possible to follow the path around the mountain on the 
initial stretches of a processional way to the summit. A little way around is an 
open area overlooking the beautiful Wadi Siyyagh, with plenty of rock-cut caves 
- whether they're tombs or houses isn't certain - as well as a small High Place, 
in perfect isolation above a prominent crow-step facade and sunken courtyard 
in the so-called Convent Group of monuments. Beyond, though, the Nabatean 
stairway is worn and dangerous, and the best way up to the summit is now via 
a staircase on the southern flank of the mountain, for which you must return 
to Nazzal's Camp.
The Unﬁnished Tomb and Columbarium
Overlooking the rubbly hill directly behind Nazzal's Camp is one of Petra's 
most interesting monuments, the Unfinished Tomb. This is a part-complete 
facade, and shows how Nabatean craftsmen worked from the top down, 
scooping out the interior as they went. Beside it is the Columbarium, a 
strange monument covered inside and out with hundreds of tiny square niches 
that had an unknown function: the name literally means "dovecote", implying 
that each niche held a bird, but no dove could roost here and the niches seem 
too small to hold funerary urns, as has also been suggested.
PETRA | Petra: The city centre

303
The Al-Habees Crusader fort
To reach the Crusader fort on the top of Al-Habees, you should continue 
south up the rubbly hill from the Columbarium, and follow a sign pointing 
right, even though it appears to point at the blank rubbly cliffside. As you get 
nearer, you'll spot the modern, restored stairs which take you up to the summit; 
it's an easy fifteen-minute climb, although there is one wooden footbridge 
without railings on the way. A gate with a rock-cut bench marks the approach 
to the fort, after which you'll have to scramble over loose stones up to a 
gatehouse. From here, you must find your own way the last little bit to the top; 
steps rise at one point over the barrel vault of a small room. The layout of the 
ruined fort itself - only occupied for a few decades in the twelfth century - is 
jumbled and confusing, but the 360-degree views are quite stunning.
Wadi Siyyagh
Just to the north of Al-Habees, Wadi Siyyagh - which takes the waters of the 
Wadi Musa down to Wadi Araba - was formerly one of the most gorgeous and 
quiet short walks you could make in Petra. This was once an exclusive residen-
tial neighbourhood of the city, enclosed between high walls, and there are 
plenty of houses and tombs, a Nabatean quarry and a well to explore. However, 
the wadi is now a short cut for local people driving their pick-ups, and a cave 
near the eastern end is home to a generator that keeps the Basin Restaurant and 
the Department of Antiquities offices operational; the roar of the thing echoes 
for a good half-hour down the wadi, the first 150m of which are now also 
covered with litter.
Persevere with the walk, though, and after half an hour or so you'll reach the 
well-tended "Roman Gardens" (not Roman at all), now maintained by local 
people. Beyond, you'll find pools and waterfalls en route to Bir Mathkoor (see 
p.356) in the desert of Wadi Araba, 16km from Petra, but route-finding is not 
always obvious in this harsh terrain and some scrambling on steep cliffs is 
necessary; you should be fully confident in your skills, or hire a guide for the 
journey.
The Monastery
Petra's most awe-inspiring monument is also one of the most taxing to reach. 
The Monastery (ad-Dayr in Arabic) boasts a massive facade almost fifty metres 
square, carved from a chunk of mountain nearly an hour's climb northwest of 
the city centre, 220m above the elevation of the Qasr al-Bint. Daunting though 
this sounds, there are well-trodden steps the whole way, as well as plenty of 
places to rest; a tranquil holy spring two-thirds of the way up is almost worth 
the climb by itself. Even if you've had your fill of facades, the stupendous views 
from the mountain-top over the entire Petra basin and the Wadi Araba make the 
trip essential.
Whether you want to ride a donkey to the summit or not (prices are very
negotiable), you'll most likely have to beat off the hordes of kids riding 
alongside offering them as "Air-condition taxi, mister?" Bear in mind that the 
archeological authorities would prefer that you walked: all those little hooves 
are seriously degrading the Nabatean-carved sandstone steps on the route up. 
Either way, by far the best time to attempt the climb is in the afternoon; not 
only is the way up mostly in shadow by then, but the sun has moved around 
enough to hit the facade on the summit full-on.
PETRA | Petra: The Monastery

304
The route up to the Monastery
The route passes in front of the Basin restaurant and museum, and leads dead 
ahead into the soft sandy bed of the Wadi ad-Dayr. The steps begin after a short 
distance, and soon after there's a diversion pointed left to the Lion Triclinium, 
a small classical shrine in a peaceful bushy wadi, named for the worn lions that 
flank its entrance. A small round window above the door and the doorway 
itself have been eroded together to form a strange keyhole shape. The frieze 
above has Medusas at either end; to the left of the facade is a small god-block 
set into a niche.
The processional way up to the Monastery is broken after another patch of 
steps by a sharp left turn where the Wadi Kharrubeh joins from in front; a little 
way along this wadi - off the main path - you'll find on the right-hand side a 
small biclinium, a ceremonial dining room with two stepped benches facing 
each other. Back on the path, after a step-free patch, the climb recommences. 
Some twenty or thirty minutes from the Basin, where the steps turn sharply left, 
you can branch right off the main path into a narrow wadi; double-back to the 
left, follow a track up and then right onto a broad, cool, protected ledge 
overlooking a deep ravine below. This is the Qattar ad-Dayr, an enchanted

mossy grotto enclosed by high walls, completely silent but for the cries of 
wheeling birds and the continual dripping of water; it's a perfect spot for a 
picnic. Here, the one place in Petra where water flows year-round, the 
Nabateans built a triclinium and cisterns, and made dozens of carvings, including 
a two-armed cross.
As the steps drag on, the views begin to open up, and you get a sense of the 
vastness of the mountains and valleys all around. With tired legs, it's about 
another twenty minutes to a small sign pointing right to the Hermitage, a 
sheer-sided pinnacle of rock featuring a less-than-gripping set of caves carved 
with crosses. Another ten minutes, after a squeeze between two boulders and a 
short descent, and you emerge onto a wide, flat plateau, where you should turn 
right for the Monastery.
The Monastery
The Monastery facade is so big that it seems like an optical illusion - the 
doorway alone is taller than a house. A local entrepreneur has thoughtfully set 
up a café in a cave opposite: sink down at one of the shaded tables in front to 
take in the full vastness of the view. At first glance, the facade looks much like 
the Treasury's, but it's much less ornate; indeed, there's virtually no decoration 
at all. The name "Monastery" is again a misnomer, probably suggested by some 
crosses scratched inside; this was almost certainly a temple, possibly dedicated 
to the Nabatean king Obodas I, who reigned in the first century BC and was 
posthumously deified. Inside is a single chamber, with the same configuration 
of double staircases leading up to a cultic niche as in the Qasr al-Bint and the 
Temple of the Winged Lions. The flat plaza in front of the monument isn't 
natural: it was levelled deliberately, probably to contain the huge crowds that 
gathered here for religious ceremonies. You can pick out traces of a wall and 
colonnade in the ground to the south of the plaza, near where you entered. 
The opposite side (the left flank of the monument as you face it) has a 
scramble-path which can take you up to the urn on the top of the facade, 
which is no less than 10m high. Leaping around on the urn is a test of mettle 
for the local goat-footed kids, and some even shimmy to the very top; follow 
them with your life in your hands.
There are dozens more monuments and carvings to explore around the 
Monastery, not least of which is a cave and stone circle directly behind the 
refreshments cave. At any point, once you climb off ground level, the views 
are breathtaking. The cliff to the north (left) of the facade is punctuated for 
well over 100m with Nabatean caves, tombs and cisterns; some 200m or so 
north of the Monastery, you'll stumble onto a dramatically isolated High 
Place, with godlike views over the peaks down to the far-distant Wadi Araba, 
over 1000m below.
The only route back into Petra from the Monastery is the way you came up. 
Like all these descents, it's too rocky and isolated even to think about attempting 
it after sunset.
Further aﬁeld
There are plenty of sights of interest to explore beyond Petra's central valley. 
Although they're more difficult to reach, and generally have less striking archi-
tecture once you arrive, just the experience of hiking through Petra's incredible 
landscape is thrilling enough: all of these walks involve getting well off the 
PETRA | Further afield

306
popular tour-group tracks, and it's quite possible the only people you meet will 
be local families. Few visitors to Petra venture beyond the city-centre sights, the 
High Place and the Monastery, but if you do you'll be greeted by a panorama 
of barren peaks and wild canyons. All but experienced trekkers should take a 
guide to enter this wilderness.
Sights within striking distance are ranged along Petra's main valley to either 
side of the city, so we've divided the treks into two sections, namely southwest
and northeast of Petra's city centre. Siq al-Barid (known as "Little Petra")
and Baydha, some 9km north of Petra, are treated separately: they're accessible 
on long walks across country, but with the distance involved you're more likely 
to want to get to them on a half-day taxi excursion.
Southwest of Petra
Walking routes to the southwest of Petra begin from the Amud Faraoun. A path 
from there drops down to follow the main Wadi Thughra along the base of 
the cliffs, from which all the following sights can be reached. Umm al-Biyara
is the flat-topped mountain overlooking the whole of Petra; a tough climb up 
steps delivers you to Nabatean ruins and the remains of a seventh-century BC 
Edomite settlement, and to vertiginous panoramas few people other than 
mountaineers ever get to experience. The Snake Monument, a single block 
carved as a huge snake, is over 2km southwest of Petra but on the flat. From 
there, a path branches out to the steps leading up the holy mountain Jebel 
Haroun, on the summit of which is the little white shrine visible from just 
about everywhere in Petra and Wadi Musa, the tomb of Moses' brother Aaron. 
Beyond the Snake Monument, Sabra is a southern suburb of Petra, mostly 
unexcavated and featuring a semi-ruined amphitheatre, a full day's hike on the 
flat through gorgeous open countryside.
Umm al-Biyara
Petra's hardest climb (other than off-route scrambling) is up Umm al-Biyara, 
likely to take a full hour from base to summit and requiring something of a head 
for heights: a couple of exposed scrambles might give you the flutters. You 
definitely need a guide, and should only make the climb in the afternoon when 
the east face of the mountain is in shadow.
As you head southwest from the Amud Faraoun, Wadi Umm Rattam comes 
in from the left after 350m; keep straight and, a little beyond, branch right (west) 
on a path directly towards a gully on the western edge of the massif, itself dotted 
all the way along with facades at different levels. The initial stages of the 
Nabatean processional way have collapsed, but a little to the south you'll find 
some modern steps, which lead you round to join the Nabatean path again 
higher up, part original, part restored. A little further is a sweeping hairpin ramp, 
deeply gouged out of the rockface to form a high corridor. Beyond here, the 
way is often eroded and, though there are some cairns to mark it, the drops are 
precipitous. You emerge at the south edge of the summit plateau, a scrubby 
slope that rises another 30m to the highest point on the northwest. The 
Edomite settlement is dead ahead, with many high dry-stone walls and 
corridors excavated; from the evidence of lamps, jars and looms, it seems that 
this community was a quiet, peaceful one, but it must have been important 
enough to receive a letter from Qaush-Gabr, king of Edom around 670 BC: his 
seal was discovered in the ruins. Biyara means "cisterns", and there are plenty up 
here, probably Nabatean. All along the eastern rim are ruins of Nabatean 
buildings commanding spectacular bird's-eye views over the Petra basin, 275 
sheer metres below; the mountain vistas to the west, from the highest point of 
PETRA | Further afield

307
the plateau, are no less stunning. There are only two ways down: the fast way, 
and the way you came up.
The Snake Monument
The path to the Snake Monument is the same as for Umm al-Biyara in the 
initial stretches, except instead of branching off the Wadi Thughra you should 
keep going ahead through the undulating countryside. This was (and is) the 
main road into Petra from the south. After around thirty minutes or so you'll 
see a very prominent, top-heavy god-block atop an area of caves and tombs 
which has been dubbed the "Southern Graves"; these caves are still inhabited 
by Bdul families, so you shouldn't be exploring too inquisitively without being 
invited in. Poised above and to the left of the god-block, not immediately 
apparent, is the Snake Monument, a worn block carved with a large, coiled 
serpent overlooking the tombs and houses below. If you head another five 
minutes or so along the valley, you'll come to a flat area with trees that's been 
fenced around and cultivated; it's here that paths divide - south to Sabra, 
southeast towards the foot of Jebel Haroun.
Jebel Haroun
Jebel Haroun - Aaron's Mountain - is the holiest site in Petra and one of 
the holiest in Jordan, venerated by Muslims as the resting place of Prophet 
Haroun, as well as by Christians and Jews. There persists some local resistance 
to tourists casually climbing the mountain simply for the views, or to gawk: 
you should bear in mind that this is a place of pilgrimage. The trip there and 
back takes at least six hours from Petra city centre, involving a climb of 
almost 500m (a donkey can take you for all but the last twenty minutes), and 
you shouldn't attempt it without a guide, six to eight litres of water, some 
food, respectable clothing and a sense of humility. Don't bother if you're 
expecting an impressive shrine (it's small and unremarkable) or outstanding 
views (they're equally good from the Monastery and Umm al-Biyara). If you 
choose to visit, you should consider bringing a sum of money with you to 
leave as a donation.
Rosalyn Maqsood, in her excellent book on Petra (see p.403), explained the 
power of Jebel Haroun well:
Believers in the "numinous universe" accept that certain localities can be impreg-
nated with the life-giving force of some saint or hero - transforming the sites into 
powerhouses of spiritual blessing. Traces of their essential virtue would cling to 
their mortal leavings even though their spirits had passed to another and better 
world. Holiness was seen as a kind of invisible substance, which clung to whatever 
it touched. So the virtues (the Latin word virtu means "power") of saints would 
remain and be continually renewed and built up by the constant stream of prayer 
and devotion emanating from the pilgrims who found their way there. These places 
are visited to gain healing, or fertility, or protection against dangers psychic and 
physical, or to gain whatever is the desire of the heart. Jebel Haroun is such a 
place... There is nothing there, really, and no one to watch you - so why should you 
remove your shoes, or leave an offering? Only you can answer this.
From the cultivated area near the Snake Monument, a path leads down into 
the Wadi Magtal ad-Dikh. A little beyond a cemetery on the right-hand side, 
and past a rock ledge called Settuh Haroun (Aaron's Terrace) at the foot of the 
mountain, where pilgrims unable to climb make an offering (Burckhardt 
slaughtered his goat here), there is a reasonably clear path up the mountain. 
Check in the tent at the bottom of the mountain whether the guardian will be

around to open the shrine at the top; if not, you should collect the keys from 
him before heading up.
A plateau just below the summit was the location of a Byzantine monastery
dedicated to Aaron; excavations are ongoing under a Finnish team. The small 
domed shrine of Haroun on the peak was renovated by the Mamluke sultan 
Qalawun in 1459, replacing earlier buildings which had stood on the same site. 
Up until then, the caretakers had been Greek Christians, and it was in the late 
sixth century that the Prophet Muhammad, on a journey from Mecca to 
Damascus, passed through Petra and climbed Jebel Haroun with his uncle. The 
Christian guardian of the shrine, a monk named Bahira, prophesied that the boy 
- then aged 10 - would change the world. Today, pilgrims bedeck the shrine 
with rags, twined threads and shells, the Muslim equivalent of lighting a candle 
to the saint.
Sabra
At the zenith of its economic power, Petra must have been processing goods 
from dozens, possibly hundreds, of caravans, and it was obviously not desirable 
to have hordes of foreign merchants - not to mention camels, random travellers 
and all the hangers-on associated with the caravan trade - pouring into the city 
centre. The Nabateans therefore built for themselves "suburbs" on all the main 
routes into the city, where business could be done, camels fed and watered, and 
goods stored well away from the sensitive corridors of power. Bir Mathkoor
(see p.356) in Wadi Araba was the western suburb dealing with trade to and 
from Gaza; Siq al-Barid (see p.311), the northern, for trade with Palestine and 
Syria; al-Khan (the area near the modern ticket gate) may have been the 
eastern, receiving goods from the Arabian interior; and the southern suburb - 
with goods arriving from the Red Sea and Hejaz - was Sabra. Little has been 
excavated here, and the walk from Petra (9km) could take two and a half hours 
or more, much more appealing as a day-long round-trip hike in open country 
than a ruin hunt.
There are two routes down to Sabra from Petra, both on the flat the whole 
way. The first, and more open, goes from the cultivated area near the Snake 
A two-day hike to Jebel Haroun and Sabra
A fascinating walking route from Petra involves a technically not too challenging 
seven-hour trek (20km) over Jebel Haroun to the solitude of the Roman theatre in 
Wadi Sabra, beyond which is a palm-fringed spring, followed on the second day by 
a direct route back to Petra (9km).
Though the Sabra valley is obvious when looking south from the summit of Jebel 
Haroun (the route up the mountain is given on p.307), the best way into it is not. After 
you've returned down the zigzag path from the summit, note the small paths which 
lead southeast across the upper edge of the valley to a ridge on its far side. Follow 
this ridge down to reach Wadi Sabra, and continue down to ﬁnd the theatre partially 
concealed by oleanders. The "Waters of Sabra" spring lies just beyond. There are 
rough spots for wilderness camping nearby. On the second day, the route back to 
Petra takes a direct line northeast up Wadi Sabra, following the main (right) fork of 
the watercourse where the valley splits. Finding your route only becomes tricky after 
emerging from the valley, 4km before Wadi Musa: your objective is clear but the way 
to it is not, and you're faced either with a scramble up the long hillside to the Scenic 
Road hotels, or devious route-ﬁnding along the lower slopes to arrive near the Petra 
gate. This is not a trek for the inexperienced, but anyone familiar with mountain 
terrain should be able to hike it with conﬁdence.

al-Btahi pass between peaks before dropping to the sandy wadi floor; shortly 
after, Wadi Sabra joins from the left. As an alternative, you could head 
southwest from Amud Faraoun, then after 350m turn left (southeast) along 
Wadi Umm Rattam, which crosses to hug the eastern side of the valley 
below Jebel Nmayr; after a little less than an hour, aim right (southwest) 
to follow Wadi Sabra, which is eventually joined by the first path. A little 
ahead are the ruins of Sabra, set in beautifully green, rolling countryside 
well watered by a spring, Ain Sabra. On the left is a large rock-cut theatre
with, above the auditorium, a large cistern that was used to provide a head 
of pressure for flooding the place so that the Nabateans could apparently 
indulge in mock sea battles. Ruinous evidence of the size of Nabatean 
Sabra is everywhere around - houses, monumental buildings, niches and 
several temples.
Continuing south from Sabra through the awesome canyons of lower Sabra 
and Tibn to the villages of Taybeh or Rajif is a more serious prospect and takes 
a further day or two. It's wild and magnificent country, only suitable for experi-
enced trekkers or those with a knowledgeable guide. Routes are described in 
detail in Tony Howard's book on trekking in Jordan (see p.404).
Northeast of Petra
There are two main walking routes northeast from Petra, following the two 
wadis that join the Wadi Musa in the city centre. On the western side of the 
valley is the quiet Wadi Turkmaniyyeh - also often called Wadi Abu 
Ullaygeh - along the bank of which runs the only driveable track into and 
out of Petra (forbidden to the general public without written permission from 
the Wadi Musa tourist police). On the eastern side of the valley, the rocky 
Wadi Mataha hugs the east face of Jebel al-Khubtha, giving access to 
strenuous walking routes out to Wadi Musa town which avoid the Siq. Set in 
the heart of the lunar-looking domes behind the Crowne Plaza hotel is the 
ruined Crusader fort of Wu'ayra.
The Wadi Turkmaniyyeh route
Joining the Wadi Musa between the Qasr al-Bint and the Basin Restaurant, Wadi 
Turkmaniyyeh is a very pleasant walking route to take out of Petra to the 
north, a small sandy valley with the hundred-metre-high jagged cliffs on your 
left contorted into weird shapes. There are two groups of tombs along the way: 
if you enter the Wadi Muaysreh ash-Shargiyyeh, which joins Wadi 
Turkmaniyyeh on the left barely five minutes from the restaurant, after about 
350m you'll come to a dense gathering of facades; and five minutes further 
northeast along Wadi Turkmaniyyeh you'll see, ranged up on the Muaysreh 
Ridges to your left, plenty more, with niches, double-height courtyards and a 
tiny High Place dotted among them. Either of these areas would repay 
scrambled exploration, well away from the crowds; and both Wadi Muaysreh 
ash-Shargiyyeh and its neighbour Muaysreh al-Gharbiyyeh provide walks (7km; 
2hr 30min) linking Petra with Baydha and Siq al-Barid, both of them emerging 
from Petra's valley onto a cultivated plateau 4km southwest of Siq al-Barid 
(which is concealed behind a small hill).
About 1km along Wadi Turkmaniyyeh from the Basin restaurant you'll see the 
facade of the Turkmaniyyeh Tomb on the left, with the entire bottom half 
broken away. Between the two pilasters is the longest inscription in Petra in 
Nabatean, a dialect of Aramaic, dedicating the tomb and the surrounding 
property to Dushara. All the gardens, cisterns and walls mentioned in the 
PETRA | Further afield

inscription must have been swept away by the floodwaters of the wadi, as, 
indeed, the facade almost has been.
From here, the road begins 1500m of tight switchbacks as it climbs the 
ridge to the police post on the outskirts of Umm Sayhoun, the breezeblock 
village constructed for the Bdul in the 1980s. Buses shuttle regularly from 
the village into Wadi Musa, about 4km away; they follow the road to the 
right, curling around the head of the valley and south past Wu'ayra to the 
Mövenpick hotel.
The Wadi Mataha route
From the Sextius Florentinus Tomb (see p.295), a path hugs the Jebel al-Khubtha 
northeast along the broad Wadi Mataha. After 300m or so, you'll spot a 
complex of rock-cut dwellings known as Dorotheos' House set into the cliff 
on your right, so called because the name "Dorotheos" occurs twice in Greek 
inscriptions within a large triclinium here. Opposite, on the western side of the 
wadi, are Mughur an-Nassara (the "Caves of the Christians") a still-populated 
rocky crag dotted with dozens of tombs and rock-cut houses, many of which 
are carved with crosses (thus the name). The whole outcrop is worth exploring 
and commands an excellent view of Petra from the north. About 600m 
northeast from Dorotheos' House is the point at which the narrow Sidd
Maajn joins the larger Wadi Mataha from the east.
There are two routes back to civilization from here, neither of them 
particularly easy, and both susceptible to flash-flooding in the winter and 
spring. First - and less complicated - is to follow the Wadi Muthlim route 
(see p.285) in reverse; this brings you to the dam at the mouth of the Siq. 
The other route takes you into the heart of the mass of rocky domes west of 
Wu'ayra, where it's easy to get lost; from the Wadi Mataha, you should be 
certain you have at least two hours of good daylight left, or you may find 
dusk falling with you stranded in a hundred-metre-high blind gorge and 
nobody in earshot. From the Sidd Maajn junction, continue north only 
another 100m or so along Wadi Mataha, and scale the dark rusty rocks to 
your right. This ridge gives you a view down into the Sidd Maajn from 
above, and along the parallel wadis leading south away from you into the 
mountain. As you walk left (east), you'll spot - like an enchanted bridge - a 
Nabatean aqueduct, gracefully spanning a wadi below. You need to aim for 
the wadi which leads south-southeast into the domes from a point directly 
at the foot of the aqueduct; make a wrong move at this point, and you'll have 
trouble later on extricating yourself. This is Wadi Sha'ab Qays and, like all 
of the wadis hereabouts, is long, straight and perfectly still; tracks and fresh 
goat droppings are good signs that you're going roughly in the right 
direction. You'll have to scrape past woody oleanders rooted in the sandy bed, 
but the going is easy enough until you reach a gigantic boulder (featuring an 
endearing little niche) all but blocking the way. There's just enough room to 
squeeze through on the right. Much further along, you'll come across a 
Nabatean water channel, which you can follow all the way out of the domes 
and towards the Crowne Plaza hotel.
Wu'ayra
On the edge of the domes, only about 200m east of Wadi Sha'ab Qays but 
utterly inaccessible from it, stands the Crusader fort of Wu'ayra. The ruins 
themselves are only of passing interest, but the location of the place is fairy-tale 
stuff, balanced on a razor-edge pinnacle of rock with sheer ravines on all sides 
and a single bridge giving access.
PETRA | Further afield

311
After King Baldwin led the Crusaders into Transjordan in 1115, founding 
their headquarters at Shobak, his forces rapidly set about consolidating their 
defences; Wu'ayra (called by them Li Vaux Moise, or "Moses' Valley") was one 
outpost constructed the following year, al-Habees another, with forts also going 
up at Aqaba and Tafileh. Wu'ayra was only briefly in Frankish hands, though: 
after some tussling over possession, Salah ad-Din seized control for good only 
seventy years later.
The fort is only accessible off the road towards Umm Sayhoun about 1km 
north of the Mövenpick hotel, the spot handily marked out by a gaping rectan-
gular tomb to the left of the road. Aim for a gap in the rocks about 10m left of 
the tomb, and you'll find the straightforward path down to where the bridge
spans the chasm. The gatehouse on the other side, with benches and a graffitied 
niche, gives into the castle interior, rough, rocky and ruined.
"Little Petra" (Siq al-Barid) and Baydha
Petra's northern suburb of Siq al-Barid is often touted to tourists as "Little
Petra" - which, with its short, high gorge and familiar carved facades, isn't far 
wrong; however, although it sees its share of tour buses, the place retains an 
atmosphere and a stillness that have largely disappeared from the central areas of 
Petra. Adding in its location in gorgeous countryside and its proximity to 
Baydha (a rather less inspiring Neolithic village), it's well worth half a day of 
your time. Most travellers choose to visit by taxi, combining the two places with 
a quick peek at Wu'ayra (see above) on the way; the going rate for a full car 
from Wadi Musa there and back, with a wait included, is about JD15.
"Little Petra" (Siq al-Barid)
The route follows the road north from the Mövenpick hotel, past the Wu'ayra 
fort. Just beyond here, where the road curves left, you can park on the 
shoulder for one of Petra's best views, a breathtaking sweep over the central 
valley of the ancient city, with many of the monuments in view, dwarfed by 
the mountains.
Further on, past Umm Sayhoun, the road heads on across rolling, cultivated 
uplands that are breathtakingly beautiful after Petra's barren rockscapes. About 
8km from the Mövenpick, a T-junction signs Shobak to the right (this is the 
back-route to the King's Highway; see p.269). The entrance to the Siq
al-Barid, or "Little Petra", itself is about 800m to the left. You are now 
beyond Bdul territory in the lands of the Ammareen tribe; a signpost points off 
the Little Petra access road to the Ammareen campsite (see p.271). In front is a 
parking area, where kids hawk trinkets and guides offer their (unnecessary) 
services.
This whole area was a thriving community in Nabatean times, and there's 
evidence in almost every cranny of Nabatean occupation. Just before you reach 
the Siq entrance, there's a particularly striking facade on the right, with a 
strange, narrow passage for an interior.
As you enter, you'll realize why this was dubbed Siq al-Barid (the "Cold Siq"): 
almost no sun can reach inside to warm the place. It's only about 350m long, 
with alternating narrow and open sections, and differs from most areas of Petra 
firstly in the density of carved houses, temples and triclinia - there are very few 
blank areas - and secondly in the endearingly quaint rock-cut stairs which 
lead off on all sides, turning it into a multistorey alleyway that must once have 
hummed with life. Feel free to explore on all sides; there are a few highlights, 
but every corner has something worth seeing. In the first open area is what was 
probably a temple, fronted by a portico, below which is a very explorable little 
PETRA | Further afield

312
rock-cut house. The second open area has four large triclinia, which could well 
have been used to wine and dine merchants and traders on their stopover in 
Petra. A little further on the left, stairs climb up to the Painted House, a 
biclinium featuring one of the very few Nabatean painted interiors to have 
survived the centuries: on the ceiling at the back is a winged cupid with a bow 
and arrow; just above is a bird, to the left of which is a Pan figure playing a flute. 
The third open area culminates in rock-cut stairs which lead through a narrow 
gap out onto a wide flat ledge; the path drops down into the wadi (Petra is to 
the left), but you can scramble up to the right for some excellent views.
Baydha
If you emerge from the Siq al-Barid and head right on a track that hugs the 
cliff all the way round, after fifteen minutes or so you'll come to the Neolithic 
ruins of Baydha, which date from around nine thousand years ago, when the 
first experiments in settled agriculture were happening. There are two main 
levels of occupation: the first, from about 7000 BC, involved building a wall 
around what was formerly a temporary camping ground. The round stone 
houses inside were partly sunk into the ground and supported on a framework 
of vertical wooden posts (now rotted away). The occupants seemed to have 
farmed goats and possibly other animals, as well as cultivating a wide variety of 
cereals and nuts: querns, tools and stones for grinding and flints are dotted all 
over the site. After a fire sometime around 6650 BC, the village was rebuilt with 
"corridor houses", characterized by long, straight walls and large communal 
areas in addition to smaller rooms. Sometime around 6500 BC, and for a reason 
as yet unknown, Baydha was abandoned. Although the Nabateans later farmed 
the site, no one lived here permanently again.

PETRA | Travel details

Petra unpackaged
Of all Jordan's tourist destinations Petra is the most 
celebrated - and the most packaged. A modern gateway 
marks entry to the site; you follow a path neatly laid with 
gravel and deﬁ ned with kerbstones; you pass standardized 
souvenir kiosks; you explore on pre-deﬁ ned trails. Yet less 
than twenty years ago you could roam at will - there were no 
trails and no kiosks - and twenty years before that you could 
spend the night in the ancient city. Tourism has forced the 
pace of change, but there are still many unusual perspectives 
to discover.

Petra by night
One of the most powerful - and, oddly, 
easiest - ways of capturing some of the 
old magic of exploring Petra is to book 
for the locally run "Petra By Night" 
walking excursion. Turn to p.278 for a 
full account of the practicalities, timings 
and prices. If you play your cards right, 
hang back at the end of the group, and 
take your time on the walk in, you can 
find yourself pretty much alone for most 
of the evening, walking quietly through 
the Siq under starlight and allowing some 
of the majesty of Petra's natural setting
to come through in a way that is often 
lost in the dust, the heat and the bustle of 
a daytime visit.
Petra as it was 
Although Petra is visually stunning even 
if you know nothing of the site's history, 
a little knowledge of who built these 
monuments (and why) can add hugely 
to your experience of the site - and 
also allows your imagination to recreate 
some of what Petra must have felt like 
in its heyday. As the images on this page 
show - one of the Qasr al-Bint temple 
as it is today, the other an authentic, 
accurate rendering of what the same 
building would originally have looked 
like, as created by archeological designer 
and artist Chrysanthos Kanellopoulos 
(see p.297) - what today appear to 
us to be heaps of dusty ruins at one 
time formed a graceful, elegant city. 
Grand temples and busy shops lined the 
main streets. Fountains played alongside 
lush gardens. A cosmopolitan mix of 
merchants and townspeople relaxed 
in cool, shady spots out of the sun. 
Learning about Petra's past enriches any 
stroll through its present.

Petra through the 
back door
Almost everybody who visits Petra stays 
in a hotel in the adjacent  town of Wadi 
Musa, walks in and out through the 
main gateway, follows the main path for 
most of the day and sees Petra's major 
monuments - the Treasury, the Theatre, 
the Monastery, and so on - in the same 
order. This works very well if you have 
limited time, but if you have more than 
one day there is much to be said for 
tackling some new approaches. 
There's no need to stay in Wadi 
Musa: you may find small, locally 
run guesthouses opening soon in the 
neighbouring village of Umm Sayhoun, 
run by the Bdul tribe (see p.293), or you 
could opt to stay with the Ammarin 
tribe, who operate an excellent camp 
(see p.271) near Little Petra. Staying 
with the Ammarin takes you completely 
out of Petra's usual run of packaged 
experiences, and also gains you access to 
Ammarin guides, who are able to lead 
you on their own paths through the 
hills and into the ancient city the back 
way - so that you walk through the site 
against the tide. The celebrated Dana-
Petra trek (see p.256) often includes 
this route. 
In future years look out for a new 
nature reserve, due to be established 
by Jordan's Royal Society for the 
Conservation of Nature (RSCN) in the 
hills of Jabal Mas'uda, south of Petra. As 
well as new walking trails and lodge-style 
accommodation, this will offer more 
unusual approaches - perhaps riding 
into Petra on horseback, or trekking for 
several days to reach the city as merchants 
might have done millennia ago.

Married to a Bedouin
Marguerite 
van 
Geldermalsen, 
author 
of Married to a Bedouin (www
.marriedtoabedouin.com) - the story of how 
she came to Petra as a tourist and ended 
up staying - reflects on the changes she has 
witnessed.
"I started writing Married to a Bedouin
when I realized how much our way of 
life had changed.
When Mohammad and I were married 
in Petra in 1978, about seventy families 
lived in the ancient site; some in tents of 
woven goat-hair and others, like us, in 
2000-year-old caves. They herded goats, 
planted winter crops and sold trinkets 
and old coins to the tourists. I learned to 
live like them - carting water from the 
spring, baking bread on an open fire and 
using kerosene for our lamps.
In 1985 we were moved to the 
overlooking hillside of Umm Sayhoon, 
partly to protect the archeological site 
but also to improve our quality of life 
with running water and electricity. Our 
children attended the village school and 
we became commuters - going into 
Petra to tend our souvenir and coffee 
shops, then riding home on camels and 
donkeys to turn on our televisions, put 
laundry into our washing machines and, 
eventually, hook up to the internet.
Mohammad and I had been married 
24 years when he died. Soon after, I left 
Jordan. I felt my reason for living there 
had gone.
Now I understand that I left to write 
my story; I needed the distance to 
see clearly. Although Mohammad is no 
longer in Petra, through him I have 
become woven into the fabric of the 
place. In 2007 I returned - and settled 
straight back in."

The southern desert 
and Aqaba
T
he huge eastern deserts of Jordan are mostly stony plains of limestone 
or basalt, but much of the southern desert to the south and southeast 
of Petra is sand, presaging the dunes and vast emptinesses of the 
Arabian interior. The principal town of the south, Ma'an, is eminently 
missable, but you shouldn't leave Jordan without having spent at least some 
time in the extraordinary desert moonscape of Wadi Rum, haunt of 
Lawrence of Arabia and starting point for camel treks into the red sands. At 
the southern tip of the country, squeezed onto Jordan's only stretch of 
coastline, the peaceful town of Aqaba is a pleasant counterpoint to the 
breathtaking marine flora and fauna which thrive in the warm Red Sea 
waters just offshore.
Two of the three north-south highways connecting Amman with Aqaba are 
desert roads, and only really of interest as access routes to and from southern 
Jordan, so we've included them in this chapter. The easternmost of the three, 
the so-called Desert Highway, follows the line of the old Hejaz Railway and 
serves as a demarcation boundary between well-watered hills to the west and 
the open desert. The westernmost of the three is the Wadi Araba road, which 
hugs the line of the Israeli border south of the Dead Sea. The middle route of 
the three - the King's Highway - is covered in detail in Chapter 5.
Transport is straightforward. Plenty of buses run along the Desert 
Highway to Ma'an and Aqaba, and you can get connections from both of 
them to all other destinations in the region. Aqaba is also a major entry point 
to Jordan, with an international airport, a land crossing with Israel and a ferry 
port serving Egypt.
Destinations in the south are often less appealing than the journeys to get to 
them, and the freedom a rental car gives really comes into its own when you're 
travelling in the desert here. Being able to stop and walk even 100m away from 
the highway, to get a firsthand experience of the wide open vistas rather than 
seeing them skim past a dirty window, is a fine way to get a taste of this incred-
ible natural environment.

The Desert Highway
The fastest but least romantic of the three routes linking Amman and the south 
of Jordan, the Desert Highway can whisk you from the capital to Petra and 
beyond in a fraction of the time the same journey would take on the slow 
King's Highway - but with a fraction of the interest. For the most part, the 
journey south is framed by bleached-out desert hills rolling off into the distance, 
the monotony broken only by feeder roads branching west at regular intervals 
to towns on the King's Highway - in north-to-south order, Dhiban, Karak, 
Tafileh, Dana and Shobak (all described in Chapter 5) and Wadi Musa/Petra 
(Chapter 6). The Desert Highway is the route followed by tankers and heavy 
lorries running between Aqaba's port and the industrial zones around Amman 
and Zarqa; it may be a dual-lane highway but traffic can be dense in parts. This 
is also the principal road into and out of Saudi Arabia, and all summer long 
features a tide of big, well-suspensioned minivans packed with holidaying Saudi 
or Gulf families heading north to resorts in Syria or Lebanon. Most people 
prefer doing these huge cross-desert drives in the cool of the night, so you'll 
find services on the highway open until the small hours but often shut in the 
heat of the afternoon.
This route is older than it appears, as the road was built mostly along the line 
of the Hejaz Railway (see p.110), which itself shadowed earlier Ottoman 
pilgrimage routes through the desert from Damascus to Mecca. During the 
sixteenth century, the Ottoman authorities built forts roughly a day's journey 
(about 30km) apart all down the length of the route, to guard local water 
sources and to serve as accommodation for the pilgrims; some of these "hajj 
forts" survive today, but almost all are ruined and/or inaccessible, the preserve 
of kestrels and archeologists.
Qatraneh
From Amman's 7th and 8th Circles, the Desert Highway (doubling up in its 
initial stretches as the Airport Road) heads more or less due south. After exits 
for the Dead Sea, then Madaba and then the airport itself - at which point the 
glitzy billboard ads lining the highway abruptly halt - traffic swishes on south 
past the busy town of JIZA (with its Mamluke fort, now a bedouin police 
station) and the infamous desert prison at Suwaqa. Just before Suwaqa, some 
74km south of 7th Circle, is a small blue sign for Qasr Tuba pointing east into 
the desert; the ruins repay the effort needed to reach them (see p.201), but you 
need a 4x4 and a knowledgeable guide for the 54-kilometre desert journey.
Many bus drivers take a break at QATRANEH, 90km south of Amman. This 
dusty town has made a living out of introducing roadside culture to Jordan, and 
a handful of generally decrepit and overpriced snack bars line the highway, 
exploiting nod-and-wink understandings with bus operators to fleece hungry 
passengers. If you have your own transport, make instead for the excellent 
Baalbaki Tourist Complex, 9km north of Qatraneh (T079 550 1793), also known 
as Qasr al-Janoob ("South Castle"). Kept clean and very well equipped, it boasts 
spotless public toilets (ask for the "Western toilets", which are usually kept 
locked), a basic canteen-style restaurant, a small supermarket, authentic crafts 
from Bani Hamida and other charitable foundations (priced no higher than in 
Amman) and a bookshop of sorts. Out back, alongside a simple garden shaded 
by olive trees, are a few plain but comfortable motel rooms (3), all en suite.
Within Qatraneh, the small two-storey hajj fort (signed as Qatraneh Castle), 
built under the sixteenth-century Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, is

situated by a wadi 300m west of the road and is in well-preserved condition. 
The guardian will let you in (he deserves a tip), and a wander round the empty, 
restored interior makes for an atmospheric interlude.
Just beyond Qatraneh is the turn-off west to Karak. Continuing south on the 
Desert Highway, you'll pass the Sultani Tourism Complex (T079 556 1245), 
23km south of Qatraneh, another popular rest area, complete with restaurant 
and souvenir shops, but there's little more to distract you. Around Hasa, 50km 
south of Qatraneh, are some phosphate mines; other major signposted turn-offs 
include at Jurf ad-Darawish (69km south of Qatraneh) west to Tafileh; at 
Husseiniyyeh (83km) west to Dana and east to Jafr; and at Unayza (92km)
west to Shobak and Petra.

MA'AN, 214km south of Amman, is the capital of the southern desert, a dyed-
in-the-wool bedouin town at the meeting point of highways from Amman, 
Iraq, Aqaba and Saudi Arabia, as well as countless smaller desert roads and tracks. 
A frontier staging-post from its earliest days, Ma'an only began to assert itself 
after the Hejaz Railway came through in 1904, transforming an isolated desert 
encampment into a thriving settlement. Even after the establishment of Trans-
jordan, Ma'an lay in a poorly demarcated frontier zone, with closer links to the 
Hejaz region of northwestern Arabia than to Amman. These days farmers come 
in to do business in the markets, and the Hussein bin Talal University brings a 
little student colour to the streets, but for the most part Ma'an is an ordinary, 
hard-working city. It is bypassed by the Desert Highway, and there's little reason 
to visit other than to grab a bite or to change buses. The bus station lies on the 
edge of the old quarter, where Hejazi-style mud-brick houses cluster around 
palm-laden wadis, and shady gardens - sealed off from the outside world behind 
crumbling walls - make for a pleasantly cool retreat in such a hot, dry city. A 
short stroll from the bus station is the signposted Ma'an Castle - not a castle 
at all, but a sixteenth-century hajj fort. It has been in continuous use since then, 
and was the town prison as late as the 1980s. It is currently used by the Ministry 
of Culture and Department of Antiquities, but is usually open - you're free to 
wander around the courtyard and peek into the old rooms. Behind, on the 
banks of a wadi, is the King Abdullah Gardens, featuring shady spots to relax 
under the palms, a kids' playground and a small café.
The King Abdullah I Palace and Museum
Ma'an's sole touristic draw is the King Abdullah I Palace and Museum
(Sun-Thurs 8am-4pm; free), a grandiose title for a modest, late-Ottoman stone 
building near the old train station, which was where Abdullah stopped in 1920 
on his intended push northwards from the Hejaz to Damascus. After he left in 
February 1921, it was used briefly as a hotel before lapsing into disuse, prior 
to renovation in the mid-1990s. The interior has now been converted into a 
small museum, mostly comprising photos of Abdullah conducting interna-
tional diplomacy as the Emir of Transjordan in the 1930s and 1940s. Captions 
are in Arabic only, but the guardian can talk you through the highlights. 
Adorning one wall is the first-ever Jordanian flag, flown for the first time in 
1918, before the country existed. Glass cases hold household items from 
Abdullah's stay, and the crumbling walls still show remnants of the original 
frescoed decoration dating from the time of Sultan Abdel Hamid II. There 
haven't been any passenger trains in Ma'an for decades, and the railway - just 
beyond the museum building - is now used solely for transporting phosphates 
from desert mines to Aqaba port.

To reach the museum, head 2km east of town on the road towards Mudawwara 
and Azraq, then follow the signed turn-off right for 1km. There's no public 
transport, but a taxi will take you there and back for a few JDs.
Practicalities
Ma'an is the hub of public transport in the south, and if you can't find a bus 
running directly from one southern town to another you can almost always find 
a connection from Ma'an instead. The bus station is 500m southeast of the 
town centre, and has reasonably regular services to and from Amman, Karak,

Tafileh, Shobak, Wadi Musa and Aqaba, although things slow down noticeably 
after about 2pm. Less regular buses serve Diseh, near Rum, as well as the desert 
outposts of Mudawwara (on the Saudi border) and Jafr (on the Azraq road).
Of Ma'an's hotels, the central Krishan (T03 213 2043; 1) is basic but 
comfortable, with an atmospheric veranda. Out on the highway access road, the 
grimy Tabouk (T03 213 2452; 1) and more welcoming Shwaikh (T03 213 
2428; 1) offer just-about-adequate rooms with or without bathroom.
The main produce market on Palestine Street is crammed with fruit and veg, 
and it's in the streets nearby (in the shadow of a huge communications tower) 
that life in Ma'an is at its most active, with decent local restaurants and a 
scattering of shawerma and falafel stands in between clothes shops and banks.
East from Ma'an
A junction 7km east of Ma'an town centre marks the start of two long, desolate 
roads through the desert. The main route is southeast to the Saudi border post 
of Mudawwara, and there are few reasons to venture onto this long, quiet road 
if you're not actually intending to cross the border - although if you have a 4x4, 
it's worth searching out a guide to help you navigate the three-hour, hard-to-
follow route across the desert west from Mudawwara to Rum. Some 80km 
beyond Ma'an is a well-preserved station of the Hejaz Railway at Batn al-Ghul, 
while at MUDAWWARA itself, 113km southeast of Ma'an - also with a well-
preserved station, now occupied by a friendly extended family - an old railway 
carriage blown up in 1917 by Lawrence and the Arab armies still rests near the 
disused tracks. Occasional buses run from Ma'an to Mudawwara. The Saudi 
border lies 15km beyond Mudawwara.
The other road from the junction 7km east of Ma'an leads northeast to 
Azraq (see p.202) and onwards towards Iraq, but the only buses along here 
terminate at JAFR, an amiable but rather dilapidated village 58km out of 
Ma'an. Few vehicles pass this way, and getting stuck out here without a ride in 
the endless Plains of Flint under a scorching sun wouldn't be much fun. Jafr's 
only claim to fame is that it is set on the edge of a huge salt flat, smooth and 
hard as a tabletop, where in 1997 a British team clocked up an impressive 
869kph in the world's fastest car, ThrustSSC, before going on to the Nevada 
desert to set a new world land speed record of 1228kph. A road from Jafr heads 
past a large Jordanian air force base west to Husseiniyyeh on the Desert 
Highway, but if you continue north without exiting at Jafr, the only thing 
breaking the long desert drive is a speed bump located outside a police post 
71km north of the village. From then on, there's only the regular tha-dum of the 
concrete road under your wheels until you reach Azraq, 209km north of Jafr. 
With a 4x4, you can follow the rough desert track 15km east of the police post 
to the remote settlement of BAYIR, site of an ancient Nabatean fort and well, 
still used by the bedouin today.
South from Ma'an: Ras an-Naqab
The principal route from Ma'an to Petra (33km) runs from the centre of 
town across the Desert Highway and through Udhruh. Continuing south 
from Ma'an on the Desert Highway itself you'll pass another couple of exits 
marked for Petra (both of which meet the road from Udhruh just above Ain 
Musa), and then the Al-Anbat Tourist Complex, another rest stop. Just past here 
is the final turn-off for Petra, some 33km southwest of Ma'an; this is the 
start of the so-called "Scenic Road" which runs into Wadi Musa through 
Taybeh (see p.270).
THE SOUTHERN DESERT AND AQABA | The Desert Highway

321
A few hundred metres further, the Desert Highway reaches the edge of the 
highland plateau at RAS AN-NAQAB, from where the most stupendous 
panoramic views over the sandy deserts of the Hisma region suddenly open up 
in front of you. Pull off, if you can, to savour them.
Once you've negotiated the route down from Ras an-Naqab, the highway 
scoots across the sandy floor of the desert, with the sheer mountains of Rum 
clearly visible off to the left of the road for much of the way. Some 41km from 
Ras an-Naqab and a little beyond the village of QUWEIRA, a clearly marked 
left turn at Rashdiyyeh points the way to Wadi Rum.
Wadi Rum
One of the most spectacular natural environments in the Middle East, the desert 
scenery of WADI RUM (rhymes with "dumb", not "doom") is a major highlight 
of a visit to Jordan. The wadi itself is one of a sequence of parallel faults forming 
valleys in the sandy desert south of the Shara mountains. They are oriented almost 
perfectly north-south, shaped and characterized by giant granite, basalt and 
sandstone mountains rising up to 800m sheer from the desert floor. The rocky 
landscape has been weathered over the millennia into bulbous domes and weird 
ridges and textures that look like nothing so much as molten candle-wax, but it's 
the sheer bulk of these mountains that awes - some with vertical, smooth flanks, 
others scarred and distorted, seemingly dripping and melting under the burning 
sun. The intervening level corridors of soft red sand only add to the image of the 
mountains as monumental islands in a dry sea. Split through by networks of 
canyons and ravines, spanned by naturally formed rock bridges and watered by 
hidden springs, the mountains offer opportunities galore for scrambling and rock-
climbing, where you could walk for hours or days without seeing another soul.
However you choose to do it - and the best way is to book in advance for 
a one- or two-day tour with one of the specialist local guides listed on p.327 
- you should clear at least one night in your schedule to sleep in the desert
here. The sunsets are extraordinary; evening coolness after the heat of the day is 
blissful; the clarity of the desert air helps produce a starry sky of stunning 
beauty; and the tranquillity of the pitch-dark desert night is simply magical. It's 
an unforgettable experience.
Bear in mind, too, the extremes of temperature: although it may be 
killingly hot during the day, nights even in summer can be chilly and, in winter, 
a dusting of frost isn't uncommon.
Some history
Although an arid, open desert, the Rum area is far from depopulated. Wadi 
Rum and its surrounds have abundant fresh water, and, aside from the tents of 
semi-nomadic bedouin scattered in the desert, there are a handful of modern 
villages in the area, including Rum itself in the heart of its eponymous wadi. 
There's also extensive evidence of past cultures, with plenty of rock-carved 
drawings and ancient Thamudic inscriptions still visible (the Thamud were 
a tribe, cousins of the Nabateans, who lived as nomads in the deserts of northern 
Arabia), as well as a single, semi-ruined Nabatean temple.
T.E. Lawrence ("of Arabia") waxed lyrical about the Rum area, describing it 
as "vast, echoing and godlike", and, appropriately enough, much of the epic 
Lawrence of Arabia was filmed here in the early 1960s, prompting tourists to visit 
in dribs and drabs during the years after.
THE SOUTHERN DESERT AND AQABA | Wadi Rum

322
However, until the late 1980s, Rum village was still comprised mostly of 
bedouin tents at the end of a rough road, with a single radio-phone serving 
the lone Desert Patrol fort. In 1984, a British climbing team led by Tony 
Howard requested permission from the Ministry of Tourism to explore the 
possibilities for serious mountaineering in and around Wadi Rum. With 
assistance from the bedouin and the backing of the ministry, an excellent 
book resulted, which brought the area into the forefront of mainstream 
tourism for the first time.
Since then, the local Zalabieh and Zuwaydeh bedouin - sub-clans of the 
great Howeitat tribe that is pre-eminent in the area - have established

co-operatives to organize tourism. With the proceeds of their cooperative, 
the Zalabieh of Rum village built breezeblock houses and a school, and 
bought buses to link the village with Aqaba and Wadi Musa. The mid-1990s 
saw a tourist boom that has shown few signs of abating: during the peak 
months of March, April, September and October, the deserts around Rum 
can be thronged with visitors, a strange mix of budget backpackers, well-
heeled groups bussed in on whirlwind tours, and serious professional 
climbers. Rum is now a Protected Area under the control of ASEZA, the 
municipal authority of Aqaba, and controls have been put in place to limit 
environmental degradation while allowing sustainable tourism to continue. 
Bureaucratic disputes aside, you'll quickly find that, however you manage it, 
escaping into the desert is infinitely more rewarding than hanging around 
the Visitor Centre amid the tour-group hubbub.
Arrival
There's only one road into Wadi Rum, signposted east off the Desert Highway 
at the village of Rashdiyyeh, which lies 41km south of Ras an-Naqab and 42km 
north of Aqaba. This road, shadowed by a freight-only railway track, skirts the 
mountains and a couple of hamlets for some 17km to a fork in the road marked 
by a police post: the village of DISI (also spelled DISEH) and other hamlets 
lie to the left, while the road ahead bends right into the long avenue of Wadi 
Rum itself, passing after 4km the Visitor Centre on the way towards RUM
village, where the tarmac ends.
By bus and taxi
With most visitors booked on all-inclusive bus tours, there's very little public
transport in or out of Wadi Rum. It's impossible to make a day-trip without 
THE SOUTHERN DESERT AND AQABA | Wadi Rum
Tribal territories
Although the landscapes in and around Rum look similar, three clearly deﬁned tribal 
areas intersect here. The Protected Area of Wadi Rum itself, in and around Rum 
village, is the territory of the Zalabia. The area around Disi village, east and 
northeast of Wadi Rum (including the easternmost part of the Protected Area) is 
Zuwaydeh land. North and west of Wadi Rum, around the village of Shakriyyeh, live 
the Swalhiyeen tribe.
As you approach the Visitor Centre, the jeeps parked outside the walls belong to 
the Zuwaydeh: they are permitted to follow routes only in the outlying "Operator 2" 
zone. Beyond the Visitor Centre, through the gateway, are cars belonging to the 
Zalabia; they stick to "Operator 1" routes in the central heartland of Wadi Rum. The 
Bait Ali complex (see p.327) is in Swalhiyeen territory, and has guides for camel, 
horse and 4x4 trips in this less-explored area.
There's much jockeying for position among the tribes, with the Protected Area 
administrators bending over backwards to upset nobody (and thereby pleasing 
nobody either). Although the legendary landscapes of Wadi Rum itself fall within 
Zalabia territory, there is nothing to stop you exploring further aﬁeld.
Wadi Rum is approximately:

your own transport. Bus service on Fridays is likely to be curtailed or 
non-existent.
From Aqaba, there are buses to Rum at around 1 and 3pm (JD2), with an 
additional bus sometimes departing around 11am. These aside, you could take 
just about any bus heading north from Aqaba (towards Ma'an, Amman, Wadi 
Musa or Quweira, for example) and ask to be let out at the Rashdiyyeh 
junction, from where hitching is easy: the standard price for a carload of people 
from the junction into Rum is about JD7-8.
From Petra (Wadi Musa), a bus departs for Rum at about 6am (JD5; see 
also p.000). If you miss this, take a bus towards Aqaba (or, alternatively, one to 
Ma'an and change there for Aqaba), and ask to be dropped at the Rashdiyyeh 
junction, from where you can hitch.
Chartering a taxi is a viable way of getting to Rum. Split between three or 
four passengers, fares are reasonably good value: from central Aqaba about JD20, 
from Aqaba's ferry terminal or the Israeli border crossing about JD25, from 
Petra/Wadi Musa about JD40, from Amman about JD80.
The Visitor Centre
At the entrance to Wadi Rum stands the Visitor Centre (daily 7am-10pm; 
T03 209 0600 or 077 742 0472, Wwww.wadirum.jo), at the northern edge of 
the Protected Area alongside the outcrop of Tell Hassan. This is where all buses 
and cars must stop, and where the admission fee to Rum must be paid - at 
the time of writing this was JD2 per person, but is likely to rise to JD7 or so. 
Around 35 percent of it goes to the local bedouin cooperatives (either Rum, 
Moving on from Rum
Buses out of Rum are few and far between. There is one bus to Aqaba (JD2), 
departing around 7am - another may go at about 8.30am if there's sufﬁcient demand 
- and there is one bus to Wadi Musa/Petra (JD5) at about 8.30am. That's it. These 
timings are not reliable, and you should check details with your guide or at the Visitor 
Centre in advance and on the morning itself. If you miss these, or if you want to reach 
any other point, it's fairly easy to hitch a ride out to the highway junction at Rashdi-
yyeh (expect to pay for this, up to JD7-8 if you're the only passenger), from where 
buses pass reasonably frequently, south (left) to Aqaba and north (right) to Ma'an and 
Amman. An alternative is to arrange a taxi through your guide or at the Visitor Centre. 
For a full car (three or four passengers) expect to pay about JD20 to central Aqaba, 
about JD25 to Aqaba's ferry terminal or the border crossing into Israel, about JD40 
to Petra/Wadi Musa, about JD80 to Amman.
The Seven Pillars?
Although the free handout map, and almost all tourist literature, names the soaring 
pinnacles of rock directly opposite the Visitor Centre as the "Seven Pillars of 
Wisdom", this is a fabrication, made up in the last few years by some marketing 
executive to cash in on the legend of Lawrence. (Five of the pinnacles are in plain 
view; the other two are round the side.) Lawrence never mentioned this mountain, 
and took the title of his most famous work from the Book of Proverbs (9:1): "Wisdom 
has built a house; she has hewn out her seven pillars". The local bedouin referred to 
this mountain as Jebel al-Mazmar long before outsiders had ever heard of Rum. It 
seems tragic that even they are now calling it the "Seven Pillars".
THE SOUTHERN DESERT AND AQABA | Wadi Rum

Disi or Swalhiyeen, depending on which trip you choose to take), with the 
remainder going to the Wadi Rum development administration.
The Visitor Centre is not unattractive, a sweep of low, modern buildings set 
around a large gravel courtyard; for many visitors, bussed in on whistle-stop 
tours, this will be their sole experience of the Rum deserts, and it has been 
designed with their needs in mind. There are a few small shops - including a 
nature shop (daily 8am-5pm), selling locally produced crafts and jewellery 
items - and the pleasant, welcoming Rum Gate restaurant (daily 8am-4pm; 
T03 201 5995, Wwww.captains-jo.com), which serves simple salads and a few 
daily specials, mainly to lunching tour groups - tables on the rear terrace give 
spectacular views over the open desert.
Further round is an Interpretation Hall, housing fascinating displays on 
bedouin culture, local wildlife and protection of the desert environment, 
alongside a projection room showing a short film introducing Rum. You can 
also climb the two short towers across the courtyard, for eagle-eye views over 
the magnificent landscape.
Organizing a desert excursion
Aside from walking solo, the only way for independent travellers to get out 
into the desert and see the sights is by paying for an off-the-peg driving tour, 
or by prearranging an itinerary with a local guide, who will drive you around 
and, if you choose, also host you overnight at a desert campsite. (If you've 
rented a 4x4 yourself, you shouldn't head off alone. It's very easy to get confused 
and lost in the open desert, to say nothing of ending up bogged in soft sand.)
Of the 5,500 people who live in the Rum area, including Disi and outlying 
villages, roughly forty percent make their living from tourism. However, if you 
take the 2,000 people who live in and around Rum village itself, that figure 
rises to around 95 percent. Almost everybody has given up keeping goats, and 
now survives by providing guide and driving services to visitors.
This means that the bedouin of Rum are, on the whole, skilled, business-
minded professionals: they know how to showcase the desert - and their own 
culture - to best effect. However, it pays to be aware that there are strict rules 
in place surrounding guide services.
Choosing a guide
The most rewarding, cost-effective and - in short - best way to see Wadi Rum 
independently is to choose a guide in advance and book directly with 
them.
It pays to do a bit of advance planning. Work out how much time you have 
available, and roughly what you'd like to see or do. Then compare our listing 
below with the guide recommendations at trustworthy websites such as 
Wwww.jordanjubilee.com and Wwww.nomadstravel.co.uk (and possibly 
Wwww.wadirum.info, though that site is under development) - along with 
your own research - to select a handful of guides that seem suitable. Email them 
directly to get a quote for what they can offer at what price.
Once you've made your choice, make a firm written confirmation as far in 
advance as possible - especially in the busy peak seasons of April and October 
- and at the very least two days before your arrival. Your guide is then permitted 
to meet you at the Visitor Centre (or elsewhere; some will meet you at the 
Rashdiyyeh highway junction on request), and escort you into the desert for 
your agreed programme. Guides are not permitted to pick up tourists at the 
Visitor Centre without a booking.
THE SOUTHERN DESERT AND AQABA | Wadi Rum

326
Programmes vary enormously, but an average cost for a basic overnight stay - 
a full day in a 4x4 visiting various desert sites and a night at a campsite in the 
deep desert, including all meals, transport, bedding and other facilities - is 
around JD40-60 per person, depending on the size of the group and the excur-
sions requested.
An alternative option is to bring in a licensed Jordanian tour operator, who 
can sort everything out for you - though you will pay a premium for their 
services. Many are excellent: some work with particular guides; others, including 
Petra Moon (see p.275), maintain their own campsite within the Protected Area. 
Beware the plethora of unlicensed operators - including budget hotels in Petra 
and elsewhere - who will try to convince you that their "special" cut-price tour 
is a great way to see Wadi Rum on the cheap: it is not. See the box above for 
some reasons why.
Cut-price tours of Wadi Rum: a warning
Numerous scammers - notably at cheap hotels in Wadi Musa and, to a lesser extent, 
in Aqaba, Amman and Dana - offer cut-price tours of Wadi Rum that may leave you 
disappointed. Here's why.
tWadi Rum or Disi? Unlicensed operators are not permitted to bring tourists into 
the Wadi Rum Protected Area, which is patrolled by rangers. This means that anyone 
offering cut-price tours of Wadi Rum - such as a budget hotel in Aqaba or Petra - will 
not be taking you into Wadi Rum*: they will, instead, drive you around the deserts of 
Disi nearby, and host you at one of the Disi tourist camps. There's nothing wrong with 
Disi - it's beautiful - but it's not what you're paying for. Yet these scammers will swear 
blind that you're being taken to the real Wadi Rum - even to the extent of lying to you 
about which camp you're in (we've had reports of tourists being dumped at one of 
the Disi camps by a driver who told them it was Bait Ali).
Just so you know: camps within the Wadi Rum Protected Area are small, placed in 
isolation from one another far out in the desert, accessible only by 4x4 and sleep ten 
or ﬁfteen people maximum in bedouin-style goat-hair tents. Camps at Disi are larger, 
sometimes cheek-by-jowl with one another, accessible by tour buses driving on dirt 
tracks, often set around circular performance areas with ampliﬁed music and electric 
ﬂoodlights, and sleep anywhere from 50 to 250 people, often in army-style canvas 
tents pitched in rows.
tCommission? If you pay, say, JD25 to a hotel in Petra for a tour of Wadi Rum, it's 
likely that at least JD10 of that will go straight into the pocket of the hotelier. That 
leaves JD15 for the man who's actually going to drive you around - which means you 
get a very short tour. For comparison, the going rate for a decent tour of Wadi Rum 
booked directly with a reputable guide, including overnight camping, all transport, 
meals and facilities, is roughly JD40-60 per person. Pay signiﬁcantly less than that, 
and you can be sure you'll be short-changed.
tGuide or driver? At cut-price rates you are unlikely to be hosted by a guide - that 
is, someone who lives in Wadi Rum, speaks English and can explain the area and its 
sights to you. Instead you're likely to get someone who can drive the car, but little 
else - probably friendly enough, but possibly not even Jordanian.
Being taken around the desert in a 4x4 is never cheap - why should it be? - and 
that's even more true for somewhere as extraordinary (and fragile) as Wadi Rum. Out 
here, you really do get what you pay for.
*The Cleopetra hotel in Wadi Musa is an exception - to our knowledge, this is the only 
Petra hotel offering tours that genuinely do enter Wadi Rum.
THE SOUTHERN DESERT AND AQABA | Wadi Rum

You're the boss. If you'd prefer to see the desert from the back of a camel - or
even a horse - rather than in a 4x4, say so: most guides can oblige, or will pass 
you onto a specialist. And if you want to be alone, say so: the easy-to-overlook 
downside of 4x4 excursions, and, to a lesser extent, camel treks is that neither 
allows you to soak up the silence and isolation of the desert at your own 
walking pace. It's perfectly possible to hire a guide to drive your gear out to a 
campsite in the desert while you take your time and walk there, or you could 
arrange for a one-way ride by 4x4 or camel out to a particular spot from 
where you then walk back.

Bait Ali
A great alternative base is Bait Ali (T079 554 8133 or 077 754 8133, Wwww
.baitali.com), a desert compound located in the Shakriyyeh area, just outside 
Rum. It is signposted off the main road, 15km east of the Rashdiyyeh junction 
and about 2km west of the police post marking the fork to Disi. The signpost 
leads you north across the railway and onto a desert track - passable with care 
in an ordinary car - to the site itself.
It stands hidden behind a rocky outcrop, with views across the desert plains. 
Tahseen Shinaco and his English wife Susan own and run the place; they - and 
their staff - are the height of hospitality. The public lounge areas, decorated in 
traditional style, are sheltered and cool, and include a dining and entertainment 
area. There is also a swimming pool (guests JD5, non-guests JD10); the water 
comes from aquifers beneath Disi.
THE SOUTHERN DESERT AND AQABA | Wadi Rum

Accommodation includes compact little adobe chalets (4), nicely made and 
decorated, with bamboo ceilings, tiled floors and proper beds - everything 
decent, spotlessly clean and comfortable. Some have bathrooms en suite; others 
share facilities. There are also small army-style tents (3) - check a few, since 
some beds are better than others.
The main attraction - aside from the warmth of the welcome - is that Bait
Ali is located within the territory of the Swalhiyeen tribe, who are quite 
separate from the Zalabia of Rum and the Zuwaydeh of Disi, and so are able 
to offer unique trips by camel, horse or 4x4, at their own rates, into landscapes 
that most visitors don't get to experience. Added draws include adventure 
activities such as dune-buggies and land-sailing - and this is also the base for 
hot-air ballooning trips (see box above).
Climbing in Wadi Rum
If you're intending to do technical rock-climbing, then you should contact one 
of Rum's handful of UK-trained mountain guides, all of whom have full 
equipment and plenty of experience. A few other locals also guide rock climbs; 
like many Rum bedouin they are naturally competent climbers, and have learnt 
rope techniques by climbing with experienced visitors. However, Jordan has no 
system of qualification for mountain guides: staff at the Visitor Centre can put 
you in touch with someone suitable, but you should establish his experience 
before agreeing terms. There is an informative leaflet on environmental and 
safety guidelines, Climbing and Trekking in Wadi Rum Protected Area, available free 
at the Visitor Centre. For more information, see Wwww.nomadstravel.co.uk, 
Wwww.wadirum.net and Wwadiram.userhome.ch.
Arriving without a booking
If you turn up at the Visitor Centre without a booking, check the notice-
boards by the ticket office which describe a dozen routes in and around Rum 
by 4x4 (and some others by camel), with prices for each. Simply choose 
which route you'd like to do, pay the fee and you're then assigned the next 
driver (or camel boy) in line. This can be a perfectly satisfactory way to see 
the desert: most drivers (there are dozens) are friendly and professional. 
However be aware that these guys are not guides: they may not speak English, 
may only know a few sites of interest and may not be driving the most 
comfortable 4x4 in the world.
These turn-up-and-go excursions from the Visitor Centre are divided into 
areas: "Operator 1" routes cover ground within the heartland of Wadi Rum; 
"Operator 2" routes are in more outlying (but not necessarily any less 
beautiful) areas to the north and east around Disi. At the time of writing a basic 
Wadi Rum from above
Hot-air ballooning can offer a romantic way to experience the grandeur of Wadi 
Rum. You take off - generally at dawn, although there are some afternoon ﬂights, 
depending on demand and weather conditions - from near the Bait Ali camp for a 
serene ﬂoat over the mountains: an hour's ﬂight costs JD130 per person (minimum 
three people). Other aerial adventures include sightseeing in a weight-shift ultralight
aircraft - an open-air powered glider, operated in tandem with a qualiﬁed pilot (JD30 
for 15min; JD80 for 45min). These and more are run by Jordan's Royal Aero Sports 
Club (T03 205 8050, Wwww.royalaeroclub.com), based at Aqaba airport. Book 
everything far in advance.
THE SOUTHERN DESERT AND AQABA | Wadi Rum

329
two-hour tour by 4x4 taking in the Nabatean temple at Rum village, Abu Aina 
spring and the Khazali inscriptions (Operator 1) - or alternatively the scenic 
drive through Siq Umm Tawagi (Operator 2) - costs JD35 for a full car, seating 
between four and six people. Several different tours, on various routes, last three, 
four or five hours, up to an eight-hour tour covering all major sites as far south 
as the rock bridges at Umm Fruth and Burdah, plus a sunset viewpoint, for 
JD80 for the car. By camel a short ride of one or two hours costs JD10-15 
per person, up to JD30 for a full day.
Independent accommodation and eating
Facilities for independent travellers are not great: the whole system of 
tourism at Rum is geared up either for large tour groups or for individuals 
who have booked in advance with a specific guide; in the latter case, all your 
meals and accommodation will be part of the agreed programme and so taken 
care of by your guide. In addition, since no public transport leaves Rum during 
the afternoon it's impossible to turn up on spec, do a tour in the desert and 
then depart.
However, once you've paid your admission fee at the Visitor Centre, you can 
cadge a lift down the road into Rum village, 7km south. Here, the first building 
you come to, on the right-hand side, is the Resthouse (T03 201 8867), which 
formerly served the function of information centre, meeting point, restaurant, café, 
campsite and social centre. These days, with most tourists remaining back at the 
Visitor Centre, it's quieter than it was, but is still a good place for a meal (JD10-15) 
or a quiet drink; alcohol is served. Across the road are a couple of local eateries. 
The Resthouse also offers basic accommodation (1) - either doss down on a 
mattress on the roof (with blankets), pitch your own tent on the sand behind the 
building, or use one of the tents already there (which allows access to showers).
It's also possible to turn up at one of the big tourist camps outside the 
Protected Area - which all focus on tour-group business - and negotiate a bed 
for the night (3-4 inc. half-board). Most are ranged side-by-side around the 
base of Jebel Umm Bdoun near Disi village; it's fairly easy to hitch a ride out 
there. Top choice is Captain's Camp (T079 551 0432, Wwww.captains-jo.com), 
which sleeps a total of 140 people in comfortable little half-tented suites with 
proper beds and bed linen; groups often get bussed in and out for dinner or a 
quick glass of tea under the (imported) palm trees, but it remains fairly 
congenial. Hillawi Camp (T079 675 5600) is vast, sleeping up to 400 people in 
army-style tents pitched in rows - when a big group is in this can feel almost 
like a small town in the desert, with electric lights strung across the mountain-
side above the camp, cauldrons of food cooking and dancers entertaining the 
crowds. Its neighbours - Moon Valley (Wadi Qamar), Oasis Desert, Desert Palm and 
more - are in the same mould, while Jabal Rum Camp (T079 557 3144), on the 
plains behind Shakriyyeh, sleeps 260 people in army-style tents, also with music 
and dancing nightly. There are no guides or transport available at any of these, 
though if you ask you'll be shunted along to someone who can help.
Sights and walks close to Rum
Although the Visitor Centre is geared up to a set pattern of routes, don't feel 
restricted to touring named sites: if you have a couple of hours to spare, there's 
nothing to stop you walking out across the sands in whichever direction you 
fancy.
Crossing to the east side of Wadi Rum from the Visitor Centre transfers you 
from tour-group hubbub into stillness and solitude. Following the cliffs of

An insider's view
Ruth Caswell, author of Wwww.jordanjubilee.com, has been visiting and writing 
about Wadi Rum for twenty years. Here she sheds some light on the background of 
a generation of bedouin who now make their living as tourist guides.
Two cousins I know, Muhammad and Mahmoud [names have been changed], who are 
guides at Rum, are both from the Zilabia tribe, a branch of the great Aneizat tribal 
confederation. Both of them were born in the mid-1970s, in the desert, in the family 
tent. When they were children they attended the army school in Wadi Rum, usually 
walking up to 10km in the mornings and then returning to the family camps in the 
afternoon (school ﬁnishes at about 2pm). Sometimes they rode a donkey, sharing it 
with their friends. After school and during school holidays they looked after their 
family's animals, often moving tens of kilometres across the desert in search of 
grazing. They learned to hunt for meat in the mountains, and to gather the medicinal 
herbs they found there. Both families had a number of goats, but they were (and still 
are) too valuable to be killed for meat except for special occasions.
The usual transport was by camel. Muhammad's father bought one of the ﬁrst jeeps 
to be seen in Wadi Rum when Muhammad was 12 years old; they quickly realized that 
the jeep was more expensive to run than the camel was, so its use was strictly 
rationed. It certainly wasn't to be used for things like taking the children to school. 
Muhammad's family used to spend the winters sheltered in the Barra canyon; during 
the spring they made their way slowly across the desert, spending the high summers 
on a plateau across the border in Saudi Arabia. Then back again during the autumn. 
Mahmoud's father preferred to travel from east to west, from the Mudawwara mud 
ﬂats to the Abu Aina spring in Wadi Rum.
It is not surprising that these men and their brothers and sisters know the desert 
and the mountains intimately, nor that they are good walkers.
Another trait that they nearly all share is complete independence whenever 
possible. Because they were not brought up to be able to call a doctor, a vet or a 
mechanic, they all know a fair bit about treating an injury or an illness, caring for a 
sick or injured animal or repairing a car. They are conﬁdent in their own abilities in 
almost any situation. Most of the bedouin guides in Wadi Rum have the same or 
similar backgrounds. The few exceptions are from the families that preferred to 
remain near to the fort in Wadi Rum that was built by the Desert Patrol and a sure 
source of water, rather than moving with the seasons. These people might know the 
deep desert less well than the others, but nonetheless all the Rum guides are still 
bedouin to the core. 
THE SOUTHERN DESERT AND AQABA | Wadi Rum
the massif south for a few minutes will give you a more intimate flavour of 
the desert environment than a bouncing 4x4 ride ever could. Another way 
to lose the bustle is to drive (in an ordinary rental car) past Disi to the 
unvisited villages of Twayseh and Mensheer. The desert out here is just as 
explorable - and the views just as awesome - as in and around Wadi Rum 
itself.
Below we've outlined a handful of the more popular and accessible sights 
around Rum, and also given a few pointers for hikers to get off the beaten 
track. If you intend to stay in Rum for some time, or if you're at all serious 
about trekking (guided or independent) or climbing, get hold of the 
excellent books by Tony Howard and Di Taylor (see p.403): Treks and Climbs 
in Wadi Rum Jordan has detailed, technical route descriptions, Walks & 
Scrambles in Wadi Rum is a booklet of short, easy-to-accomplish excursions, 
and some of the routes from both also feature in Jordan: Walks, Treks, Caves, 
Climbs & Canyons.

331
Any of the routes in and around Rum can be strung together to form a two-, 
three- or four-day adventure, with intervening nights spent camping in the 
desert. There are also plenty of opportunities for journeys further afield, 
including the desert track to Aqaba (50-70km), covered in a day by 4x4, two 
or three by camel. It's possible to reach Mudawwara by camel in about four days, 
Petra or Ma'an in five or six.
Jebel Rum
From the Visitor Centre, follow the road south along the west side of Wadi Rum 
for 7km to reach the Resthouse on the edge of Rum village. Jebel Rum rises to 
the right, Jebel Umm Ashreen to the left. Walking alongside the telephone poles 
that lead away behind the Resthouse, within five minutes you'll come to a small 
 Desert cairn, Wadi Rum
THE SOUTHERN DESERT AND AQABA | Wadi Rum

332
Nabatean temple dating from the first or second centuries AD tucked up 
against the daunting cliffs of Jebel Rum, with Nabatean inscriptions on the 
walls and columns overlaid by later Thamudic graffiti.
From the temple, a modern cylindrical water tank is in plain view a little way 
south; a path leads from the tank up the hillside and around the cliffs above the 
mouth of a little valley, past springs lush with mint. On the south side of the 
little valley, at the head of a Nabatean rock-cut aqueduct, is Ain Shalaaleh, a 
beautiful, tranquil spot cool with water and shaded by ferns and trees, evoca-
tively described by Lawrence in Chapter 63 of Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Nabatean 
(and modern) inscriptions are all around and there are stunning views out across 
Wadi Rum. Taking your time, you could devote a relaxing half-day to visiting 
these two places alone. 
Most camel- and car-drivers, though, can't be bothered with climbing the 
slope to reach the spring, and instead lead visitors who have negotiated for a 
trip to "Lawrence's Spring" south along the valley floor to the rather 
mundane spring at Abu Aineh, which is marked by a tent pitched alongside a 
square concrete pumping block near a scree slope. Both are valid destinations, 
but the confusion has now become written into history, with the official map 
marking Abu Aineh as "Lawrence's Spring". Insist on Ain Shalaaleh, if that's 
where you want to go.
From Ain Shalaaleh, it's not hard to work your way east around an outcrop 
and south over a pass onto a path above the desert floor. About 500m further 
on, another pass to the right will deliver you to the bedouin tent and spring at 
Abu Aineh - also easily reachable on a simple one-hour valley-floor walk 3km 
south from the Resthouse.
A much longer and more serious undertaking is to circumnavigate Jebel 
Rum - from the Resthouse to just beyond Abu Aineh, then north, passing to the 
east of Jebel Rumman and across a saddle into Wadi Leyyah - but this could take 
nine hours or more and is only for the fit. A much easier prospect is walking 
northwest from the Resthouse along the small, well-watered Wadi Sbakh, 
between the cliffs of Jebel Rum and the outcrop of Jebel Mayeen; you'll 
eventually have to make a short scramble over a saddle into the tiny, narrow 
Wadi Sid, often dotted with pools, from where a scramble leads down to the 
road a little north of Rum village, making a pleasant three-hour round-trip.
Jebel Umm Ashreen
The west face of Jebel Umm Ashreen - the "Mother of Twenty", named 
(depending on whom you talk to) for twenty bedouin killed on the mountain, 
or twenty hikers swept away in a flash flood, or a crafty woman who killed 
nineteen suitors before marrying the twentieth - is pierced by a number of 
explorable ravines and canyons. Northeast of the Resthouse, between the highest 
Walking alone: a warning
It barely needs saying, but here goes: it would be suicidally reckless to tackle any 
of the mountain routes in and around Wadi Rum without a local guide. Walking on the 
desert ﬂoor is ﬁne, but even then, if you choose to do a long-distance walk alone, 
you should register your intended route at the Visitor Centre and let staff know when 
you are planning to return. For multi-day walks, and all types of scrambling or 
climbing, it is essential to have a knowledgeable local guide with you, whether 
you're on your ﬁrst or ﬁftieth visit: this is exceptionally harsh terrain and apparently 
safe rock can be treacherous.

peak of the Umm Ashreen massif and Jebel Kharazeh, is Makhman Canyon, 
explorable for about a kilometre along its length.
Directly east of the Resthouse is an enormous ravine splitting Jebel Kharazeh from 
Jebel Umm Ejil. Just beside it, a complex maze of canyons is negotiable all the way 
through the mountain. Once up and over a concealed gully alongside the ravine - 
the only way into the mountain - you emerge on a hidden plateau dotted with 
wind-eroded towers and framed by looming molten cliffs. Diagonally left is 
Kharazeh Canyon, and you can work your way along it for some distance before 
the cliffs close in. The main route follows Rakabat Canyon southeast from the 
plateau, but path-finding is complex in this closed-in, rocky gorge, requiring plenty 
of scrambling up and down through interlinking ravines. You eventually emerge 
beneath the magnificent orange dunes of Wadi Umm Ashreen, from where you 
could walk south around the massif back to Rum village. To do the full trip (10km; 
at least half a day), you need confidence on easy rock, a good head for heights and 
experience of route-finding; if in any doubt, take a local guide.
You could also head east across the valley from the Visitor Centre into Wadi 
Siq Makhras, which narrows as it cuts southeast through the Umm Ashreen 
massif, eventually delivering incredible views over the vast and silent Wadi 
Umm Ashreen. The walk from here south around the massif to the Resthouse
(12km) can be shortened by navigating Rakabat Canyon from east to west. 
Other routes of 10-12km from the eastern opening of Wadi Siq Makhras 
involve heading northeast through Siq Umm Tawagi (see below) to get picked 
up in Disi village, or southeast to camp overnight in Barrah Canyon. If you 
don't fancy such long hikes, you can arrange in advance to be picked up at any 
identifiable intermediate spot by camels or 4x4 for the return journey.
Longer trips from Rum
For those with more time to spend in the area, there are literally dozens of 
possible jaunts, whether you're into climbing and scrambling or would prefer to 
Arabian oryx in Rum
Wadi Rum is the setting for an ongoing experiment in wildlife reintroduction. The 
Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx) - a white antelope with long, straight horns that 
formerly roamed the deserts of the Middle East - has been extinct in the wild in 
Jordan for many decades. A captive breeding programme in the 1970s and 80s at 
Shaumari (see p.210) was successful, but after the ﬁrst Gulf War 1.7 million sheep 
and goats, brought into Jordan by refugees from Iraq, decimated the rangelands 
through overgrazing, rendering the planned oryx release impossible. Oryx have 
remained in captivity at Shaumari ever since. Other regional projects have fared little 
better: Oman's oryx reintroduction recently failed due to excessive poaching, and 
schemes in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Syria and elsewhere have had varying degrees of 
success - always (bar one release area in Saudi Arabia) with the oryx remaining 
behind fences.
In 2009, after meticulous planning over several years, twenty oryx were brought to 
Wadi Rum from Abu Dhabi for acclimatization in a large, fenced zone behind Jebel 
Rum, away from tourist routes, before release into the open desert. Forty more oryx 
are due to follow, in two phases. By all accounts, the local bedouin are thrilled to see 
the animals back in the area - oryx have a uniquely poetic resonance in bedouin 
culture - and have vowed to protect them, not least because they also recognize that 
oryx-spotting safaris could become a major money-spinner. Time will tell how the 
project beds in: for up-to-date information, ask at the Visitor Centre.

investigate inscriptions. The following gives an idea of what to expect from the 
more impressive sites, but again Tony Howard's books cannot be recommended 
highly enough for their clear and detailed route descriptions. These sites are far 
enough away from Rum that you'll need to rent transport: by 4x4 a three- or 
four-hour excursion could whisk you round most of them and still leave time 
for the sunset; a stately tour by camel would take days.
South of Rum
About 8km south of Rum, on the desert track to Aqaba, rises Jebel Qattar
("Mountain of Dripping"), origin of several freshwater springs. A short walk up 
the hillside brings you to the largest spring, Ain Qattar, which was converted by 
the Nabateans into a well. Stone steps in an area of lush greenery descend into 
a hidden, underground pool of cold, sweet water, drinkable if a little mossy. 
South and west of Qattar, just off the Aqaba track in the beautiful hiking area 
around al-Maghrar are a handful of "sunset sites", popular spots for late-
afternoon 4x4 excursions (though the places that give the best sunset views 
change according to the seasons).
The titanic chunk of mountain opposite Qattar is Jebel Khazali. It's suppos-
edly named for a criminal, Khazal, who was pursued up to the summit and, with 
nowhere to run, leapt off, whereupon he miraculously floated to earth and 
landed unharmed. The mountain's north face is split by a mammoth canyon, 
entered by a ledge on the right, the inner walls of which are covered at different 
heights with stylized Thamudic rock drawings of people, horses and pairs of 
feet. It's possible to scramble your way up through the cool, narrowing ravine, 
dodging the pools of stagnant water, for about 200m until you meet unscaleable 
rock.
The area east and south of Khazali is full of small domes and outcrops, with a 
cat's cradle of wadis and hidden valleys running through and between the peaks. 
To the south, a small, easily climbed rock bridge rises from the desert floor at 
Jebel Umm Fruth, but for most trekkers the highlight of the area is the 
impressive rock bridge perched way off the desert floor on the north ridge of 
Jebel Burdah. Best photographed from the east, the bridge is best scaled from 
the west; it's an easy but serious climb, especially if you're not that good with 
heights. Non-climbers should only attempt it in the company of a guide - 
preferably one who has a rope to protect the last few metres of climbing before 
the bridge, which is dangerous and exposed. The sense of achievement at 
reaching the bridge, though, is marvellous, and the views are stupendous.
A guided ascent of Jebel Rum requires climbing competence, but an ascent of 
Jordan's highest mountain, Jebel Umm ad-Daami (1830m), some 40km 
south of Rum on the Saudi border, can be achieved by anyone - it's often 
harder to find a driver who knows the way than it is to reach the summit. Once 
you've driven there, the scramble up the north ridge is straightforward, and the 
summit provides superb views over both countries. You can overnight in the 
desert, perhaps at a bedouin camp among the beautiful Domes of Abu 
Khsheibah, midway back to Rum.
East and north of Rum
East of Wadi Umm Ashreen is an area of soft sand, with some scrambleable 
red dunes rising to 20m or more against the north face of Jebel Umm 
Alaydya. Very close by, some of the best Thamudic carvings can be seen on 
Jebel Anfishiyyeh, including a herd of camels - some ridden by hunters, 
others suckling their calves - and some strange circle-and-line symbols. A 
little southeast, Jebel Umm Kharg has on its eastern side a small Nabatean 
THE SOUTHERN DESERT AND AQABA | Wadi Rum

structure, named - wrongly - "Lawrence's House", which commands 
spectacular panoramic views out over the desert.
Further east lie Jebel Barrah and Jebel Abu Judayda, divided by the sandy, easily 
negotiable and very atmospheric Barrah Canyon, which winds between the 
cliffs for some 5km; this is an often-used overnight camping stop, the journey 
best done with camels. North of Barrah, between a group of three peaks, the 
hidden valley of Siq Umm Tawagi features plenty of Thamudic rock drawings 
as well as a totally fake recent carving of two faces which the tour guides will 
claim are Lawrence and Emir Abdullah - tragically, this canyon is now being 
dubbed "Lawrence's Siq" as a result. Umm Tawagi is a good second-day route 
from Barrah to a pick-up point in Disi village, about 15km north. From Barrah, 
it's also possible to round the Umm Ashreen massif and return to Rum.
Lawrence of Arabia
Very few of the events concerning T.E. Lawrence and the Arab Revolt can be pinned 
down with any accuracy. The Arab protagonists left no record of their actions and 
motivations, and the single account of the Revolt is Lawrence's own, his famous 
Seven Pillars of Wisdom, written after the war, lost, rewritten from memory and 
published in 1926. By then, though, the image of Lawrence as a true British hero was 
ﬁrmly in place; he was almost universally seen as a soldier of integrity and a brilliant 
strategist, honest and courageous, who acted with genuine altruism in leading the 
Arabs to victory and was betrayed by his own ofﬁcers. The image is a beguiling one, 
and stood the test of dozens of biographies. Even one of his closest friends 
describing him as "an infernal liar" didn't crack the facade.
But with the gradual declassifying of British war secrets - and dozens more biogra-
phies - elements of a different truth have slowly been taking hold. Lawrence was 
undoubtedly close to British Intelligence; indeed, even in his early 20s, Lawrence's 
work on an archeological dig in northern Syria may have been a front, enabling him 
to photograph engineering work on the nearby Berlin-Baghdad railway. His supposed 
altruism during the Arab Revolt seems to have been ﬁrmly rooted in a loyalty to his 
own country and a hatred of the French. During the Revolt, Lawrence was well aware 
of the Sykes-Picot Agreement that was to carve up the Levant, and seems to have 
wanted to establish Arab self-rule mostly to stop the French gaining any control. 
Although his own conscious betrayal of the Arabs racked him with guilt, he justiﬁed 
himself on the grounds that it was more important to defeat Germany and the 
Ottomans. Details have also emerged of Lawrence's dishonesty and self-gloriﬁcation: 
biographers who have compared Seven Pillars to documentary evidence have 
regularly come up against inconsistencies and outright lies perpetrated by Lawrence, 
often for his own self-aggrandizement.
Lawrence is much less highly regarded in Jordan, where he is often seen as an 
imperialist who sought to play up his role in what was essentially an Arab military 
victory, achieved and led by Faysal. Although he pretended to have Arab interests at 
heart, in fact - as was shown by the events after the Revolt - his loyalty to British 
interests never wavered.
Nonetheless, as the years pass and the biographies pile up, the myth persists of 
Lawrence the square-jawed, blue-eyed buccaneering English bedouin as portrayed 
by Peter O'Toole in David Lean's 1962 ﬁlm epic Lawrence of Arabia. But in 1919, 
Lawrence's friend Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen recorded a conversation that 
they'd had about the text of Seven Pillars: "He confesses that he has overdone it, and 
is now terriﬁed lest he is found out and deﬂated. He told me that ever since childhood 
he had wanted to be a hero. And now he is terriﬁed at his brazen imagination. He 
hates himself and is having a great struggle with his conscience." This seems as 
appropriate an epitaph as any to a life still shrouded in mystery.

The wild landscape north of Disi and Shakriyyeh is just as impressive and half 
as well known. Three easily accessible sites stand out to give a taste of the area. 
In the foothills just east of Disi, at the base of Jebel Amud amidst dozens of 
Thamudic inscriptions, is a large slab of rock covered in lines and interconnected 
circles which, it has been theorized, is an ancient map - although what it refers 
to isn't known. About 6km north of Shakriyyeh are some amazing Thamudic 
drawings at Abu al-Hawl; the name means "father of terror" and suits well the 
extraordinary experience of coming across two-metre-high figures with stubby 
outstretched limbs carved into a remote desert cliff. About the same distance 
again north is a breathtaking rock arch at Jebel Kharaz. You could either take a 
half-day drive out to these two spots, or treat them as stop-offs on a long desert 
journey northwest to Petra or northeast to Ma'an. Also in this area is "The 
Palace", a castle-like compound which some guides claim featured in the film 
Lawrence of Arabia. It was in fact built for the French TV game show The Desert 
Forges, which ran for one series in 2001 before being pulled.
Aqaba
Jordan's beach resort of AQABA (say it "acka-buh") glories in an idyllic, sunny 
setting on the shores of the Red Sea, at the southernmost tip of the country. 
From a standing start, in the last decade or so it has transformed itself into a 
world-class leisure destination. Hotels at all grades are springing up in the town 
as well as on the adjacent beaches and luxury waterfront developments; invest-
ment is pouring in to improve the 
city's infrastructure and facilities; 
and charter flights direct into 
Aqaba's international airport are 
allowing holidaymakers to bypass 
Amman and the north of the 
country altogether. Some of the 
best diving and snorkelling in the 
world is centred on the unspoiled 
coral reefs which hug the coast 
just south of the town - an 
engaging counterpoint to the 
nearby desert attractions of Petra 
and Wadi Rum.
The main driver of growth has 
been 
the 
Aqaba 
Special 
Economic 
Zone 
(ASEZ; 
Wwww.aqabazone.com), which 
covers the city and its surrounds. 
Set up in 2000 with tax breaks for 
business and lowered customs 
duties, it has been wildly successful. 
Aqaba is booming.
And yet, despite the recent 
appearance of package tourists flip-
flopping through the town centre 
in shorts or bikinis, Aqaba's 
proximity to - and historical links 
with - Saudi Arabia make this

actually one of the more socially conservative urban centres in Jordan. Histori-
cally neither a trading port nor a commercial hub, Aqaba was only ever significant 
as a stopping-off point for pilgrims travelling to and from Mecca. If you've come 
expecting a pacy, cosmopolitan mini-Beirut, or mini-Dubai, you'll be disappointed. 
The contradictions between deep-set tradition, big business and mass tourism look 
set to give small-town Aqaba a lively spin in the years ahead.
The town is starting to experience a year-round high season. Jordan's 
standard peaks (March-May & Sept-Nov) are supplemented by European 
tourists seeking Aqaba's pleasantly warm sunshine in the winter months (Dec-
Feb). Summer (June-Aug) is the main Saudi and Gulf holiday season, and also 
when Eastern European holidaymakers come to sizzle on the beaches. The hajj 
pilgrimage - in November until 2011, then October from 2012 - is an added 
complication, with thousands of Egyptian and North African pilgrims stopping 
off in Aqaba on their way home. And the town can be booked solid on holiday 
weekends, as Ammanis and others head for a short break by the seaside.
Another factor to reckon with is the extreme heat and humidity. During 
the four mild months around Christmas, a few days in Aqaba can pleasantly 
warm the chill of Amman from your bones (not for nothing does King 
Abdullah keep a winter residence here), but for the rest of the year, daytime 
temperatures damply soar. The four months of summer can be stifling, with July 
and August's fifty-degree days and thirty-degree nights too much to bear.
Some history
For years Aqaba was overshadowed by its huge Israeli neighbour Eilat, which was 
founded in 1949 on what used to be arid desert and is clearly visible sprawling 
around the opposite shore of the Gulf of Aqaba. However, Aqaba's location is 
much more naturally favoured than Eilat's: a series of freshwater springs barely a 
metre or two below Aqaba's beaches has ensured almost continuous habitation 
Developing Aqaba
With tax breaks stimulating international investment into Aqaba, the range of devel-
opment projects in and around the city is dizzying. In recent years, the entire city 
centre has been revamped, with new street furniture, public art and extensive re-
planting of palm trees (after the palm groves that used to line Aqaba's shore had all 
been uprooted by previous, less visionary city authorities). New shopping malls have 
gone up, large numbers of hotels have opened or are due to open, extensive 
residential suburbs are being built to cater for the city's ballooning population and 
plans have been unveiled to move the entire port, from its current position on the 
edge of the city centre 20km south to the area beside the Saudi border, thereby 
opening up a fresh area of waterfront for leisure development. Tala Bay (Wwww
.talabay.jo), a wedge of luxury apartments, hotels and restaurants around a marina 
and sandy beach 15km south of Aqaba city centre, is already open - with a golf 
course on the way - as is (after 2010) the Saraya development west of the city centre 
(Wwww.sarayaaqaba.com), taking in villas, apartments, hotels, water parks and 
beach facilities. Under development behind Saraya, and due for completion in 
phases up to 2016, is Ayla Oasis (Wwww.aylaoasis.com), where a narrow section of 
seafront is being opened up to feed into a large lagoon extending inland against the 
Israeli border; expect more luxury residences and a string of four- and ﬁve-star 
hotels, as well as perhaps an access channel to serve the projected Red Sea-Dead 
Sea canal (see p.131). Add in plans to revamp some admittedly shabby, run-down 
parts of the city centre, and Aqaba, already rejuvenated in the last decade, looks set 
to be transformed.

of the shore at least since Nabatean times, although the town in or near Aqaba's 
position has changed names many times. In biblical times it was called Elot. 
Through the Roman and Islamic periods this was adapted variously into Aela, 
Ailana or Aila. The Arabic word aqaba means "alley", and is a shortening of 
"Aqabat Aila", a title referring to the narrow Wadi Yitm pass that was the only 
route into the town through the mountains to the north.
One of the earliest references to the area comes in the Old Testament 
(I Kings). King Solomon built a large port at Ezion Geber "beside Elot on the 
shore of the Red Sea" both for trade and also to house his new navy. During 
the 1930s, excavations at Tell al-Khaleifeh, a little west of Aqaba, seemed to 
indicate occupation around the time of Solomon, but archeologists - hampered 
by construction of the modern Jordanian-Israeli border fence - later pinpointed 
occupation to have begun during the eighth century BC, much later than 
Solomon. Ongoing investigation is suspended while the tell lies in a militarily 
restricted zone, but nonetheless the real Ezion Geber must have been close by.
The Nabateans controlled a series of ports from Aqaba all down the eastern 
Gulf coast. Aqaba's fresh water also ensured that the town became a caravan stop 
for merchants arriving from Arabia, with routes leading north to Petra and 
Syria, northwest to the Mediterranean coast at Gaza and west across the Sinai 
desert into Egypt. A highway constructed by the Roman Emperor Trajan in 
111-14 AD led to Aqaba from his provincial capital at Bosra (Syria).
Recent excavations beneath the beach have revealed the world's oldest 
purpose-built church, dated to around 300 AD; during the Byzantine
period Aqaba was the seat of a bishopric. It was the first prize to fall to the 
Muslims on their military advance northwards in 630, and flourished 
throughout the early Islamic period, hosting a theological seminary. By the 
tenth century, Aqaba was an important stop on the pilgrimage route to 
Mecca.
On their push into Transjordan after 1115, the Crusaders - led by Baldwin 
of Jerusalem - seized the town and built a castle, although no trace of it survives. 
 Courtyard of the Mamluke fort, Aqaba

In response, the Muslim resistance fortified a small offshore island, known to the 
Crusaders as the Île de Graye (today dubbed Pharaoh's Island), and within a 
century Salah ad-Din had retaken Aqaba on a campaign which eventually led 
to Jerusalem.
A small Mamluke fort on the shore was rebuilt in the early sixteenth century 
just before the Ottoman seizure of power, and it survives today. For three 
hundred years, Aqaba became again an important caravan stop, but the opening 
of the Suez Canal in 1869 dealt a death blow. For the first time, seaborne trade 
around the region, and between Europe and Asia, became an economically 
viable alternative to the camel caravans; equally, for Turkish and Syrian Muslims, 
making the pilgrimage to the Holy Places by sea through Suez was infinitely 
preferable to the arduous journey through the desert via Aqaba. The town's 
fortunes rapidly declined, and during the 1917 Arab Revolt, the forces of 
Faysal and Lawrence were able to surprise the small Ottoman garrison by 
approaching through the desert from the north: with all defensive artillery 
directed towards the sea, Aqaba fell with barely a skirmish. Ironically, when 
David Lean arrived in 1962 to stage the same incident for Lawrence of Arabia, he 
thought Aqaba looked wrong - and so departed to film the sequence in 
southern Spain instead.
Modern Aqaba
The sleepy fishing village was only dragged into modernity following a 1965 
readjustment of the international border: Saudi Arabia got a patch of interior 
desert in exchange for Jordan's gaining an extra few kilometres of coastline and 
coral reef south of Aqaba. This made room for construction of full-size port
facilities, and since then Aqaba has seen a resurgence in overland trade, although 
the camel caravans of antiquity have been replaced by a continuous stream of 
juggernauts: Aqaba port is the sole outlet for Jordan's principal export, 
phosphates, as well as the transit point for goods trucked to and from Iraq. With 
the recent shift in priorities away from industry towards beach tourism, the 
dowdy, endearingly run-down Aqaba of old is being unceremoniously shoul-
dered aside - and its long-standing fishing industry has been reduced to just a 
hundred individuals.
Arrival
The highway entering Aqaba from the north coils along the line of the Wadi 
Yitm, still today, as in antiquity, the only negotiable route through the craggy 
mountains that seal Aqaba off. Bypass routes to the port ensure that heavy 
trucks are diverted away from the city. As you approach the outskirts, you 
might have to stop for a brief luggage inspection at a customs post marking 
the boundary of the Special Economic Zone (see p.65 for more). The 
highway heads on into the centre of town, connecting with the Corniche, 
or coast road; this hugs the shore right (west) to a hotel zone, and left (east) 
past the city centre to the South Coast, location of more hotels and beaches, 
plus the port and ferry terminal.
Aqaba is approximately:

Buses from Amman, Petra (Wadi Musa), Wadi Rum, Ma'an and elsewhere 
arrive at the bus station, opposite the police station in the city centre; those from 
Karak (via Safi) terminate on a street nearby. Of the express buses from Amman, 
JETT stop at their company's office on the Corniche north of the centre beside 
the Mövenpick hotel, while Trust stop at their company's office on An-Nahda 
Street in the centre. Onward transport from Aqaba is covered on p.353.
Aqaba's King Hussein International Airport (code AQJ) is 9km north of 
the city, off the Wadi Araba road. Most flight arrivals are charters, with ground 
transfers laid on. Taxis gather to meet the few scheduled flights, charging about 
JD12 into the city centre.
From Egypt or Israel
See pp.35-36 for full details. Ferries and catamarans from Nuweiba in Egypt 
dock at the passenger terminal, 9km south of town. Arrival is straightforward, as 
is getting your visa. Taxis gather outside the terminal gates to whisk passengers 
into town for JD1.50 per person or JD6 for the whole car. Smaller cruise 
ferries from Taba Heights dock at the marina in Tala Bay, 15km south of Aqaba, 
from where a taxi fare into town is about JD10 (some dock beside the huge 
flagpole in central Aqaba - walking distance from hotels).
The Wadi Araba border between Israel and Jordan (known in Israel as the 
Yitzhak Rabin or Arava crossing) is 5km north of Aqaba, off the Wadi Araba 
road. Serveeces do the run into town for about JD3 per person or JD12 for the 
car. Alternatively, you could take a taxi direct from this border to Wadi Rum 
(JD25) or Petra (JD40).
Information and city transport
Aqaba's tourist office (daily 8am-8pm, Nov-March closes 6pm; T03 203 
5360, Wwww.aqaba.jo) occupies a small hut under the trees in the parking area 
behind Aqaba's main central roundabout, a short walk from most of the hotels. 
Staff are friendly and knowledgeable, offering free maps and information about 
goings-on around town.
Although there is a network of city buses, most serve outlying suburbs. The 
simplest way to get around town is on foot: walking the length of the 
Corniche (from the InterContinental hotel to the fort) takes around half an hour. 
If it's too hot to walk, you need only lift a finger for a meterless taxi to screech 
to a stop for you; reckon on JD1-2 for ride anywhere in town. To get south 
along the coast to Tala Bay, a taxi will cost nearer JD10.
Accommodation
Aqaba has a broad range of hotel options - and by the time you read this there 
will be many more. At Tala Bay a Mövenpick was due to open as this book went 
to press, with a Hilton to follow. The Saraya development has seven hotels: the 
"six-star" Nikki Beach, the Qala'a, Qasr al-Aqaba and Dar al-Masyaf (all Jumeirah), 
Al-Manara and Bab al-Bahar (both Starwood) and Westin. Five more, as yet 
unnamed, are planned in the Ayla Oasis development behind Saraya, as well as 
a mid-range Domina Inn in the city centre and a JW Marriott.
Aqaba visas
See p.65 for details of the free visas issued on arrival at Aqaba's airport, land borders 
and ferry port.

All this will ease Aqaba's room shortage, but you should nonetheless always 
book in advance, no matter what your budget. When choosing a room, factor 
in the stifling heat: the romance of a sea view - along with a beautiful panorama 
westwards across the bay towards Eilat - brings with it exposure to the 
scorching force of the sun. For the sake of a cool night's sleep, you might do 
better to choose a room facing east to the mountains or north over the city, and 
then keep the windows and the drapes closed all day.
Budget hotels
Aqaba has a fair choice of budget accommodation, but many places are geared up 
more for long-stay Egyptian guest workers than Western tourists: below are the 
best of the bunch. You also need to bear in mind the excessive heat and humidity: 
a working ceiling fan is a minimum requirement, but if you're paying 2 prices and 
above you should be getting decent air conditioning. Either way, avoid rooms with 
west-facing windows, which get the full force of the afternoon sun. All these hotels 
are marked on the map on p.340.
Amira town centre T03 201 8840. Twelve simple 
rooms are no-frills and sensibly priced - a bit 
grimy, but otherwise comfortable and spacious. 2
Bedouin Garden Village South Coast, 12km south 
of town T079 540 1640, Wwww.bedouin-hotels
.com. About as bedouin as a bikini, but nonetheless 
a decent, attractive option for budget accommoda-
tion, with an easy-going, hippyish atmosphere. 
There's a mix of "chalets" plus clean toilets and 
showers and a pleasant, shaded tent area for 
lounging. They do inexpensive meals (ﬁsh 
barbecues are an evening favourite), and snorkel-
ling excursions. You can also pitch a tent here 
(JD10). Located 100m from the beach, above the 
road. 3
Bedouin Moon Village South Coast, 12km south of 
town T079 538 1979, Wwww.bedouinmoonvillage
.com. Located alongside Bedouin Garden Village and 
in much the same style, with similar facilities and 
atmosphere, Another option - Mermaid Village - is 
going up nearby, too. 3
Dweik 1 Town centre T03 201 2984. Another 
adequate town-centre option, slightly shabby but 
decent and welcoming. 1
Jordan Flower Town centre T03 201 4378. 
Marginally the best of the three budget hotels that 
stand beside each other on this street (the others 
are Petra and Jerusalem), with some en-suite 
rooms that aren't bad at all - big and relatively 
comfortable. 1
Mid-range hotels
Many mid-range hoteliers have gone to town on their lobby decor, but do less 
well when it comes to the rooms: a four-star reception desk can prelude 
two-star facilities. Furthermore, as much as JD15-20 can separate rooms with a 
sea view from those facing the mountains - if you're prepared to negotiate, you 
could nab yourself a bargain. All these hotels (bar the Coral Bay) are marked on 
the map on p.340.
Alcazar town centre T03 201 4131, 
Wwww.alcazarhotel.com. A friendly, 
welcoming two-star hotel, well located in the 
centre, with stone-ﬂoored rooms that are airy and 
pleasant, set around a four-storey atrium open to 
the sky. Further attractions include the Seastar 
diving centre, one of the biggest pools in town and 
free transport and access to the Club Murjan 
beach complex on the South Coast. A characterful 
choice. 3-4
Aquamarina II City town centre T03 201 5165, 
Wwww.aquamarina-group.com. Long-standing 
though rather uninspired tourist hotel in the heart 
of the city centre, offering spacious, comfortable 
rooms that are a better bet than at the other 
properties in this Aqaba-only hotel group. 7
Captain's town centre T03 206 0710, 
Wwww.captains-jo.com. Excellent upper-
three-star hotel (nearer four-star) in the centre of 
town, with sleek well-kept rooms offering a touch 
of designer style - gadgets, good fabrics, tile ﬂoors, 
chic bathrooms with bowl basins and multi-jet 
showers, and so on. Rooms are a touch on the 
compact side, but still very comfortable. Service is 
quick and professional. 7
Classic town centre T03 205 0070. Surprisingly 
good, modest boutique-style hotel slightly away 
from the tourist strip (opposite the Haya hospital). 
THE SOUTHERN DESERT AND AQABA | Aqaba

Luxury hotels
Aqaba has seen a boom in both the number and quality of luxury four- and 
five-star hotels in the last few years - and the trend is set to continue. See 
"Accommodation" above for some of the world-class hotels that are likely to 
open before this book is next revised, substantially boosting top-end room 
availability in and around the city. Hotels in town are marked on the map 
on p.340.
Rooms are spacious and well kept, and rates are 
keen: a bargain. 4
Coral Bay At the Royal Diving Club, 17km south of 
town T03 201 5555, Wwww.coralbay.jo. Well-
designed three-star hotel, with 69 rooms - most 
with a sea view - on a beautiful, quiet stretch of 
beach well away from the town bustle. Rooms are 
pleasant and have some character, though poor 
service lets it down badly and the rack rate is 
wildly overpriced - bargain hard. 7
Crystal Town centre T03 202 2001, 
Ecrystalhotelaqaba@yahoo.com. Remarkably 
good three-star hotel in the centre, overlooking 
shopping streets and near the souk. A showy, 
upmarket lobby preludes a range of large, comfort-
able rooms, well kept and rather stylish. 5-6
Days Inn Town centre T03 203 1901, Wwww
.daysinn.com. Occupying an odd building (begun as 
a shopping mall, then converted partway up into a 
hotel), this is a handsome, competitively priced 
holiday hotel with a rooftop mini-pool that sizzles in 
summer. All but a handful of the 110 rooms have 
balconies, and those that don't are huge corner 
rooms. Also several connected family suites. 6
Moon Beach Corniche T03 201 3316. Pleasant, 
comfortable small hotel well located near the fort - 
the rooms are generic though decent enough, and 
there's a good breakfast on offer. 3-4
Aqaba Gulf Corniche T03 201 6636, Wwww
.aqabagulf.com. Landmark city-centre hotel which 
gets most of its custom from tour groups and 
business travellers. Rooms are functional and 
pleasant enough, though interiors are unremark-
able. A major drawback is that it has no private 
beach and does not offer beach access 
elsewhere. 8
InterContinental Corniche T03 209 2222, 
Wwww.interconti.com. Outstanding 
ﬁve-star hotel on its own slice of beach, gazing 
south over the water. Rooms are large and very 
well appointed, and the hotel's facilities range from 
top-notch restaurants to a spa and ﬁtness centre. 
Super-stylish. 9
Kempinski Corniche T03 209 0888, Wwww
.kempinski-aqaba.com. Another ﬁne holiday hotel 
on its own sandy beach, offering chic, state-of-the-
art interiors. Every one of the 201 rooms and suites 
has a sea view, thanks to the building's curved 
design. 9
Marina Plaza Tala Bay, 15km south of town T03
209 2900, Wwww.marinaplaza.org. Four-star 
holiday hotel in the Tala Bay development, set back 
from the beach (though with beach access) and 
arrayed around a large pool area. Its 267 rooms are 
bright, spacious and modern, there's a spa, regular 
transport into town and excursions laid on. 9
Mövenpick Corniche T03 203 4020, Wwww
.movenpick.com. Lavish hotel complex, variously 
dubbed by the locals "the fairy palace" for its 
twinkling lights and "the prison" for the curiously 
designed set of bars that slides across every 
window. Inside, it's airy, spacious and beautifully 
designed, with the pool placed up on a bridge over 
the road that connects the hotel proper (on the 
north side of the road) with the condominium 
section on the beach to the south. Rooms are very 
well appointed, with everything you'd expect. 9
Radisson SAS Tala Bay, 15km south of town T03
201 4448, Wwww.radissonsas.com. Exceptional 
resort hotel in the Tala Bay marina development, 
looking out over a west-facing beach to the Sinai 
mountains opposite. The hotel is huge, offering 
more than 330 rooms of differing grades, charac-
terized by contemporary styling and ﬁve-star 
service. Several restaurants, cafés and pool areas 
- including swim-up bars and inﬁnity pools - as 
well as diving, snorkelling, ﬁshing, sailing and 
excursions persuade you never to step outside. 9
The Town
Aqaba town centre is a dense network of streets and alleys clustered around the 
junction of the Corniche and the main highway from the north. Here you'll 
find the bulk of the town's smaller hotels, dozens of cafés and restaurants, the

main produce market, access to the public beach and all of Aqaba's prome-
nading, street-based nightlife. Aside from shopping, sights within the town are 
limited to a Mamluke fort and small museum south of the centre, and the 
open excavations of Islamic-period Aila to the north. All are worth checking 
out, although try and do so early in the morning, before the sun has had a 
chance to turn up the heat. Otherwise, of course, Aqaba is perfect for relaxing 
by the pool, beach-bumming and tackling some diving and snorkelling; see 
p.348 for details.
Aqaba Gateway: the "Jordan Experience"
Alongside the main traffic circle on the Corniche rises the Aqaba Gateway, 
fronted with a McDonalds. This odd complex was conceived by Hollywood 
director Irvin "Shorty" Yeaworth (famous for 1958's The Blob) to be a mini-
theme park, hosting costumed characters parading amidst a traditional-style 
souk of spices and jewellery. It was only part-completed when, in 2004, 
Yeaworth was killed in a traffic accident near Tafileh. Subsequently, the 
building works were rushed through and the retail units filled as quickly as 
possible - with the result that it has become just another mall, packed with 
fast-food outlets, albeit with a replica Arab dhow moored on a lagoon in 
the middle.
Yeaworth's pièce de résistance (which survives him) is the multimedia Jordan 
Experience (daily hourly 11am-7pm; JD6). A guide leads you on a short tour 
through a darkened "siq", with spotlit displays and recorded voices telling 
stories of Jordan's past and present. Another door opens, and you are led into 
the world's largest motion-base cinema, something akin to IMAX, with a 
large screen and wraparound sound. The movie itself (which lasts about twenty 
minutes) comprises footage of Jordan filmed from the air: as the camera angle 
shifts, so does the floor of the cinema, tilting from side to side and forward and 
back to match the pictures. It's kitsch, but entertaining.
The public beach and ﬂagpole
Aqaba's free-entry public beach - comprising the few hundred metres from 
the Aqaba Gateway roundabout south to the fort (see below) - is a great place 
to soak up some local atmosphere. Steps lead down from the Corniche road, 
past patches of cultivated garden beneath the palm trees, to the beachfront 
promenade, where families stroll and kids sell chewing gum and knick-knacks. 
Loosely partitioned cafés have been rigged up on the beach all down this 
stretch, with radios blaring, women sitting in the shallows fully clothed, hubbly-
bubbly smoke wafting over everything, and square-eyed families glued to TVs 
balanced table-on-table within a metre of the lapping waves. Jetties extending 
out into the water are lined with café tables. It's a great spot to catch a flavour 
of what Aqaba used to be like, before the developers moved in. Needless to say, 
Aqaba from the air
Jordan's Royal Aero Sports Club (T03 205 8050, Wwww.royalaeroclub.com), 
based at a hangar alongside Aqaba airport, operates sightseeing ﬂights by micro-
light - a two-seater plane, where you sit behind the pilot and buzz to and fro over the 
beaches (JD40 for 15min; JD75 for 30min; JD100 for 45min). They also do tandem 
skydiving over the Gulf of Aqaba (JD240) and "accelerated free-fall" jumps for 
certiﬁed skydivers (JD320), as well as hot-air ballooning at Wadi Rum (see p.328). 
Always book well in advance.
THE SOUTHERN DESERT AND AQABA | Aqaba

though, this is not the place either for a relaxing spot of sun worship or for 
women to take a dip wearing anything less than an overcoat.
At the southern end of the public beach, and directly alongside the fort (see 
below), Aqaba's most identifiable landmark - a giant flagpole - soars above 
what is known as Great Arab Revolt Plaza. This open space on the waterfront, 
a focus for the evening passeggiata, commemorates the successful attack on 
Beaches, watersports and excursions
If you're staying at a hotel that does not have its own beach, ask at reception 
whether any deals are in place to allow guests beach access. Otherwise, all the ﬁve-
star beach hotels can accommodate non-guests - though for a hefty fee (roughly 
JD15-25) and you may be turned away at busy times. Elsewhere, the best and 
cleanest beaches, where foreign women will get no hassle whatsoever, are south of 
town at Club Murjan and the Royal Diving Club (about JD10-15). Both have a proper 
restaurant, and both operate private shuttle buses to and from the town centre (see 
"Dive centres", p.351).
All the big hotels, beach clubs and dive centres (listed on p.351) offer a range of 
watersports. Prices and options vary, but expect speedboat trips, waterskiing, 
banana/inner-tube rides, jetskiing, canoeing, windsurﬁng, parasailing and more. 
Many of the hotels work with the local Sindbad company (T03 205 0077 or 079 555 
6076, Wwww.sindbadjo.com), so you could check prices and offers with them 
directly.
A number of operators (including Sindbad) run cruises into the Gulf of Aqaba - 
sample prices include JD25-30pp for an eat-aboard cruise, including a modest lunch 
or dinner on the yacht, or a ninety-minute sunset cruise at JD15pp. Many can also 
rent out sailing yachts and motor yachts for private excursions or ﬁshing trips.
Pharaoh's Island
One of the most popular day-voyages is to Pharaoh's Island, a rocky islet in 
Egyptian waters about 17km southwest of Aqaba (and 250m off the Egyptian coast). 
In the twelfth century, to counter a castle at Aqaba built by the Crusaders (now lost), 
Salah ad-Din's Muslim resistance fortiﬁed this barren islet, dubbed by the Crusaders 
the Île de Graye. The castle's towers and passageways have been restored, but the 
main reason for coming is to dive or snorkel in the maze of reefs off the northeastern 
tip of the island. The only way to get there is on an organized tour, which run daily 
when there's sufﬁcient demand. Just about any hotel or dive centre can take a 
booking; expect to pay JD40-50pp, which includes everything, including lunch on 
board. Departure is around 10am, and you're back in Aqaba by 5pm. Book at least 
one day ahead, and leave your passport: the operator has to organize a temporary 
Egyptian visa. It's not possible to cross from the island to the Egyptian mainland.
Glass-bottomed boats
Otherwise you could opt for a quick trip in a glass-bottomed boat, which has a 
viewing window to see below the surface. Dozens chug around the public beaches 
sharking for customers, though many are rather dilapidated: plans are in train to 
clean them up and organize the business. A trip in one of these simple craft should 
cost around JD10-15 per hour for a full boat. (Note that some disreputable boat 
captains will dive down and snap off bits of coral to hand to their oohing-and-aahing 
clients. This is not only illegal but also kills the reef. If it happens, refuse to pay for 
the trip and report the incident to the tourist ofﬁce.) A more upmarket alternative is 
to go with a glass-bottomed boat tour through a big hotel (or Sindbad again): a 
comfortable three-hour trip, including snorkelling kit and refreshments on board, 
costs about JD25pp.
THE SOUTHERN DESERT AND AQABA | Aqaba

347
Aqaba in 1917 by Arab armies under Faysal and Lawrence, which ousted an 
Ottoman garrison and opened the way for final victory with the capture of 
Damascus the following year. At 132m, this is one of the tallest freestanding 
flagpoles in the world. It flies not the Jordanian flag, but the flag of the Great 
Arab Revolt, also adopted for a time by the short-lived Kingdom of the Hejaz 
(which fell to Saudi forces in 1925). It can be seen from all four countries 
around the gulf: Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.
Aqaba fort and museum
At the base of the flagpole stands Aqaba's atmospheric Mamluke fort (daily 
8am-7pm, winter closes 4pm; JD1). The impressive entrance is flanked by 
semicircular towers, each bearing a calligraphic invocation to Allah; the arch that 
currently spans the gap between them is much narrower than the original, the 
line of which can still be traced. Overhead is a panel bearing the Hashemite coat 
of arms, installed following the victory in 1917. The fort was built in 1320; inside 
the gloomy cross-vaulted entranceway, a long inscription runs around the walls, 
celebrating renovations by the penultimate Mamluke sultan Qansawh al-Ghawni 
("slayer of the unbelievers and the polytheists, reviver of justice in the universe") 
in either 1504-05 or 1514-15. A roundel commemorates further rebuilding 
work in 996 AH (1587 AD), by which time the Ottomans were in power.
Through a dark passageway lies a domed area, beyond which opens the large 
courtyard, dominated by a huge eucalyptus. This fort was the main focus of 
Aqaba's caravan trade for centuries, and rooms all around the walls - some of 
which have been restored - testify to its more hospitable function as caravan-
serai for much of its later life. The ruined section to the right as you enter the 
courtyard was destroyed mostly by shells fired from British gunboats during the 
Arab Revolt. Opposite the entrance is a concrete-and-plaster mosque; steps to 
the left of it can bring you up onto the highest point of the walls for a dreamy 
view through the palm trees and over the blue gulf waters.
Beside the fort is Aqaba's little museum (same hours and ticket). The collec-
tion includes coins and pottery from Egypt (including a fine lustre-ware bowl 
 A day out at the beach, Aqaba

from tenth-century Fatimid Cairo), Iraq, Ethiopia and some exquisite tenth- and 
eleventh-century Chinese ceramics. Among Islamic-era frescoes and three 
exquisite Nabatean bronze figurines, found at Wadi Rum, you'll spot the first 
milestone of the Roman Via Nova Traiana, inscribed "from the borders of Syria 
to the Red Sea" and discovered on the beach. The museum occupies part of the 
House of Sheikh Hussein bin Ali. Hussein - the current king's great-great-
grandfather - spent six months here during 1924, in an attempt to overturn the 
1923 Anglo-Jordanian Treaty, which had separated Transjordan from the Hejaz 
and Palestine (and had excluded him from power). A room contains mementoes 
of the visit: huge mansaf platters, coffee grinders, camel saddles and copperware.
Across from the fort is Souk Ayyadi, a small shop run by the non-profit 
Jordan Micro Credit Company (Wwww.tamweelcom.org), selling an 
excellent range of crafts, textiles, ceramics and jewellery from charitable 
projects all over Jordan.
Aila
The ruins of the Islamic-period town of Aila (daily 8am-sunset; free) lie in an 
unromantic location, alongside the Corniche road sandwiched between the 
Royal Yacht Club and the Mövenpick hotel. It's nonetheless an interesting site, 
well described on good information boards.
You enter through a gateway which is also more or less where the original 
Syrian Gate would have met the road from the northeast. To the right, the 
foundations of towers projecting out of the city wall can be followed down to 
the Egyptian Gate, the history of which reflects the history of the whole city. 
In the early Islamic period, the gate was about 3m wide, flanked by the two 
semicircular towers still apparent and featuring a round arch overhead. A stump 
in front is the remnant of a central column, built some time in the eighth 
century to narrow the arch. A century or two followed during which Aila was 
at its zenith; however, debris dumped outside the walls caused the ground level 
to rise, at which point the towers were used as storerooms. Rebuilding work 
resulted in the current smaller, pointed arch over the gate, but Aila's days were 
numbered, and eventually the gate was sealed, serving only as a drain.
From the Egyptian Gate you can walk along a street - well below current beach 
level - past simple shops and houses. Some 50m along, at the centre of the city, is 
the Pavilion Building, converted in the ninth or tenth century into a two-storey 
residence, with rooms set around a courtyard. The road from the Egyptian Gate 
would have continued straight across to the Hejaz Gate, now in the grounds of 
the yacht club opposite. Another road led from the Pavilion Building right to the 
Sea Gate and left to the Syrian Gate. Towards the Corniche lies what was a 
relatively large mosque, with a mihrab and double row of columns.
Some 200m northwest, in an open area behind the JETT bus station, excava-
tions have uncovered the earlier Roman and Byzantine city, including rooms, 
a city wall and remains of a church, dated to 290 or 300 AD. Though older 
buildings, in Syria and elsewhere, are known to have been converted into 
churches in the 260s, this is the oldest-known structure in the world to have 
been designed and built as a church. It was abandoned after an earthquake in 
363 and sand has preserved the mud-brick walls to a height of almost 5m.
Diving and snorkelling at Aqaba
Some of the world's best diving and snorkelling is packed along the 27km of 
coastline between Aqaba and the Saudi border, and the town has several dive 
centres. If you've never been snorkelling before, Aqaba is an easier, and more 
instantly attractive, place to start than nearby Eilat (Israel) or Sharm el-Sheikh 
THE SOUTHERN DESERT AND AQABA | Aqaba

(Egypt), with the reef shelving gently directly from the beach, cutting out the 
need for boat entries. Diving beginners can go down accompanied by an 
instructor in complete safety; there are more than a dozen dive sites along the 
coast to choose from.
The major advantage of diving in Jordan rather than Egypt's Sinai coast or the 
handful of sites off Eilat is the almost untouched condition of the coral. Fish 
abound in greater densities elsewhere in the Red Sea (although you're still likely 
to come face-to-face with more marine life than you could shake a stick at), 
but Aqaba was a relatively slow and careful starter in dive tourism, and so has 
managed to avoid severe deterioration of the reefs. Compared to the Sinai's two 
million annual dives, and Eilat's three-quarters of a million, Aqaba sees only 
about twenty thousand dives a year. Work by local environmental NGOs - 
principally the Royal Marine Conservation Society (Wwww.jreds.org) - is 
raising awareness of conservation issues. Almost 9km of Aqaba's south coast is 
protected as the Aqaba Marine Park (Wwww.aqabamarinepark.jo), which 
extends 350m offshore and 50m inland.
Wherever you choose to dive or snorkel, wide fields of near-perfect soft corals 
stretch off into the startlingly clear blue water, huge heads of stony corals 
growing literally as big as a house. Fish life is also thrillingly diverse, with endless 
species of small and large multicoloured swimmers goggling back at you from 
all sides. Butterflyfish, angelfish, parrotfish and groupers are all common, as are 
shoals of damselfish, jewelfish and even moray eels. Experienced divers should 
not miss the chance to go down at night. All the dive centres listed below offer 
one-off dives, boat dives, PADI courses and more.
Dive sites
Aqaba's South Coast hosts more than a dozen dive sites, although, confusingly, 
different dive centres use different names, and sometimes divide one site into 
two or more areas (Dive Aqaba, for instance, list more than thirty sites, including 
Coral conservation
Coral reefs are formed of millions of individual creatures called polyps, which come 
together to create a single, compound organism. The various species of polyp 
produce hard external skeletons, which remain intact after the polyp dies; sand and 
other detritus ﬁlls up holes and cracks, and the reef is built up little by little, with new 
corals growing on the surface of the stony mass. Some coral colonies are several 
centuries old. To avoid damaging the reefs:
tnever stand on the coral - any kind of pressure can damage or kill the outermost 
polyps. If you opt for a boat dive, make certain that the captain ties up to one of 
the mooring buoys already in place all round Aqaba, and doesn't just drop anchor 
onto the reef. If he claims that his selected site has no buoy, then insist that you be 
taken instead to a site that does have one.
tdon't enter the sea from the beach - the reef begins directly from the shallows. 
Instead, use jetties or boat entries.
tnever break the coral - snapping off a particularly colourful bit of coral not only 
kills that section of the reef, it's also pointless: after a few days out of water, all coral 
turns grey.
t avoid kicking up sand - clouds of grit settling on the reef can smother the 
outermost polyps.
t don't litter, feed the ﬁsh or buy marine souvenirs, such as corals, shells or 
starﬁsh.

advance about the latest conditions; the account below - which runs from 
north to south - is not meant to be exhaustive.
Just south of the Marine Science Station's fenced-off area is the King
Abdullah Reef, which extends for several hundred metres offshore and is good 
for snorkelling as well as diving; close by is the steeply sloping Black Rock, 
with a wide variety of massive hard corals and the added attraction of occasional

turtle sightings. Some 4km north of the Royal Diving Club and barely 50m 
from the shore lies the wreck of the Cedar Pride, a Lebanese cargo ship sunk 
here in 1986 as an artificial reef. Lying in 30m of water, it's now covered in soft 
corals. Very close by is the gently undulating Japanese Gardens, colourful and 
good for snorkellers. 
A little further south are the unmissable Gorgonion I and II, the reef gently 
inclining down to 30m or so with spectacular fish life and perfectly preserved 
coral growth of all kinds stretching off to all sides. The Canyon has a shallow 
slope leading off for several hundred metres to a drop-off plunging over 45m, 
the whole slope split from the shallows outwards by a steep-sided ravine; its 
neighbour, the New Canyon, hosts an old field tank, sunk here to create a 
barrier to encourage reef growth. Blue Coral, named for a bluish lacework 
coral found here, is a little south.
Just north of a fenced-off nature reserve, Moon Valley offers an undulating 
reef framed by sandy beds, and is also the entry point for the Long Swim, 
taking divers or experienced snorkellers 700m south beyond the reserve fence 
to the Royal Diving Club jetty, past patches of dense coral interspersed with 
sandy valleys. From the jetty itself, the Aquarium (to the north) and the 
Garden (to the south) are both superb for divers and novice snorkellers alike.
Independent dive centres
Warning for divers
It can be dangerous to ﬂy, or climb to altitude, soon after diving: this includes driving 
from Aqaba (at sea level) up to Wadi Rum (950m above sea level), Petra (1100m) or 
Amman (800m). If you're travelling overland, you should allow yourself at least six
hours on land in Aqaba after diving to let your body adjust. If you're ﬂying out, you 
should give yourself at least eighteen hours.

Eating and drinking
Aqaba shakes a leg when the sun goes down, and many restaurants and cafés
have terrace tables (or balconies) for alfresco dining. The obvious thing to 
plump for when you're by the sea is fish - but note that only a few bottom-end 
restaurants serve the local catch: the big hotel restaurants import all their fish 
and seafood frozen from Yemen and the Gulf. Most Arabic restaurants around 
town serve the signature Lebanese dish sayyadieh - fish (most often spiced red

mullet) on buttery rice with pine nuts. You'll also spot lots of familiar Western-
style fast-food outlets around town, from burgers to pizza to fried chicken.
If you're heading to Rum or Petra for a few days, stock up on picnic supplies 
beforehand, since even basic food in both places is priced at a premium. Check 
out Aqaba's early-morning fruit and veg market, the good Humam super-
market on Al-Batra Street or the big Safeway north of the centre.
There's not much local demand for bars: independent places tend to come 
and go, while those that survive, such as the Rover's Return in the Aqaba Gateway 
mall, can be rather bereft of atmosphere. A better bet is to aim for one of the 
big hotels, all of which have decent pubs - Abu Nawwas in the Mövenpick is one 
of the best.
Cafés and juice bars
The compact area around An-Nahda and As-Saada streets, extending onto the 
main Hammamet al-Tunisieh Street (with illuminated fountains along its 
central strip), is a great place to stroll after dark - here you'll find lots of cafés, 
families and friends walking together, people hanging out. Near the Crystal 
Hotel are juice bars offering anything from plain orange juice to sensational 
mango-guava-strawberry-banana concoctions. Dozens of tea- and coffee 
houses all over town come into their own in the evening, laying out chairs 
and setting up a TV for locals to while away the twilight hours with coffee and 
a hubbly-bubbly. Cafés down on the public beaches give much the same 
service, with added sea views. After dark, parlours on the strip in front of the 
Jordan Flower Hotel do a roaring trade in cups of super-sweet, strangely elastic 
local ice cream.
Restaurants
All these restaurants are marked on the map on p.340.
Ali Baba town centre. Landmark restaurant on the 
central roundabout, with a full complement of 
mezze and Arabic main courses, as well as a good 
ﬁsh selection. It's OK, but you rarely see any locals 
eating here. As this book went to press new 
owners were reportedly taking over, so things may 
be different when you visit.
Bourj al-Hamam At InterContinental hotel, 
Corniche T03 209 2222. Aqaba's best 
upmarket Lebanese restaurant by miles, serving 
exquisite speciality dishes on the open sea-view 
terrace. Everything, from the fresh-baked ﬂat bread 
to the salads, grills and hot and cold mezze, is top 
quality, service is warm and the setting lovely. An 
expensive treat.
Captain's Restaurant town centre, An-Nahda St 
T03 206 0710. Large, bustling restaurant on the 
main drag with a good reputation - and so often 
full. The ﬁsh is good, and you can also get dishes 
like pasta and all the normal Arabic staples at 
moderate prices.
China town centre, Al-Batra St. Climb to the top of 
the stairs for a surprisingly good Chinese, with a 
range of excellent soups and all the usual meat, 
chicken and veg dishes, plus sweet-and-sour ﬁsh. 
Good value.
Floka town centre, An-Nahda St T03 203 
0860. A rather good ﬁsh restaurant in the 
heart of the hotel district. Their sayyadieh is 
excellent, and a range of other, more familiar 
European dishes are well prepared and courteously 
served. Expect a bill in the order of JD10-15.
Mohandes town centre, Hammamet 
al-Tunisieh St. A locals' restaurant serving 
some of the best Arabic fast food in town - crispy 
falafel, tasty hummus and fuul, eggs, salads, 
shawerma and so on. JD5 will ﬁll you up.
Red Sea Grill At Mövenpick hotel, Corniche T03
203 4020. Of the hotel's range of ﬁne-dining 
restaurants, this is the stand-out choice - a 
romantic, open-air spot down on the beach, serving 
up excellent ﬁsh and seafood in a pleasant, candle-
lit ambience. Evenings only.
Royal Yacht Club town centre, off the main 
Corniche roundabout T03 202 2404, 
Wwww.romero-jordan.com. Calm, classy 
restaurant, run by Romero of Amman (a high 
recommendation) and with efﬁcient, friendly 
service. A top-quality Italian menu is padded out 
- a little incongruously - with Lebanese mezze
and Japanese sushi, but ignore all that and 
concentrate on the main attractions: pasta,

Moving on from Aqaba
Transport connections out of Aqaba include a selection of buses around 
southern Jordan and to Amman, ferry services to nearby Egypt and an easily 
accessible overland crossing point into Israel.
Domestic destinations
From the bus station in the middle of town minibuses head to Amman's Wihdat 
station via the Desert Highway (5hr; about JD6). Quicker serveeces follow the 
same route (4hr; about JD7.50). JETT (T03 201 5222, Wwww.jett.com.jo) runs 
large air-conditioned coaches (first 7am; last 7.30pm) from their office beside the 
Mövenpick hotel to three points in Amman: Wihdat station (3 daily; JD6.50), 
Tabarbour station (3 daily; JD7) or their office in the Abdali district (6-8 daily; 
JD7). Trust International Transport (T03 203 2200) runs air-conditioned coaches 
from their Aqaba office on An-Nahda Street to their Amman office near the 
Safeway supermarket by 7th Circle (4-6 daily: first 7.30am, last 7pm; JD7.50). It's 
worth calling ahead to confirm schedules and book a seat.
There are three or four buses a day to Petra/Wadi Musa (around 8-9.30am 
and 1-3pm, although timings depend on demand). Others run via Rajif to 
Taybeh village, a short bus ride from Wadi Musa. More regular buses serve 
Ma'an, from where you can catch another bus (or taxi) to Wadi Musa. Buses 
depart Aqaba for Wadi Rum at around 1 and 3pm, with an additional bus 
authentic pizza and ﬁsh mains, with an excellent 
wine list to accompany. Also has a terrace 
overlooking the marina. Expect a bill above JD20 
a head.
al-Shami town centre, Raghadan St. This narrow 
street behind the main market area is shoulder-to-
shoulder Arabic restaurants, serving simple fare at 
inexpensive prices. Despite its touristy appearance, 
this is one of the best, with good food and an 
upstairs terrace (with a/c).
Syrian Palace town centre, Raghadan St. Beside 
the Al-Shami, another great choice for low-budget 
local dishes.
Syrian Restaurant town centre, Al-Batra St. 
Ordinary locals' cafeteria serving plain but 
excellent food.
Wesalak town centre, As-Saada St. You're 
spoiled for choice for terrace cafés in Aqaba, 
but this is one of the nicest - a funky, modern, 
outgoing espresso bar-cum-meeting place with the 
most comfortable armchairs in town: install yourself 
on the pavement terrace, and let the evening drift by. 
As well as a full range of coffees and soft drinks, they 
do excellent ice cream and smoothies, hubbly-bubbly 
water-pipes and a range of low-priced sandwiches, 
light bites and simple grills and kebabs.
Tours to Wadi Rum
Tours to Wadi Rum are advertised at one-man-band tour companies and budget 
hotels all over Aqaba - if you express interest, they'll dig out a photo album of their 
adventures, plus glowing testimonials from happy customers. If all you want is to be 
driven out to a campsite somewhere in the desert near Wadi Rum (see p.326 for more 
on this), have dinner and be brought back to Aqaba in the morning - often, it seems, 
in the company of "guides" who may not be Jordanian and/or speak little or no 
English - then these jaunts (at JD20-25pp) are great value. But for more serious trips, 
cheap excursions won't do. Talk instead to experts such as Above and Below (T03
201 3735, Wwww.aboveandbelow.info). Try also Peace Way (T03 202 2665, Wwww
.jordantrips.com) and Captains (T03 206 0710, Wwww.captains-jo.com), though be 
aware that you might get fobbed off with a trip around Disi, rather than Wadi Rum. 
Another possibility - with both good and bad feedback - is Quteish & Sons, trading 
as Wadi Rum Desert Service (T03 201 3882, Wwadirumdesertservice.tripod.com).

sometimes departing around 11am; see p.324 for other options. Buses to Karak
depart from a street 100m south of the bus station. All these routes are restricted 
- or non-existent - on Fridays. Trust International Transport (see above) runs 
two coaches daily direct to Irbid (6hr; JD11.50); book the day before.
A taxi from Aqaba to Wadi Rum costs about JD20, to Petra about JD40, to 
the Dead Sea upwards of JD70.
Royal Jordanian  (T06 510 0000, Wwww.rj.com) has two flights a day from 
Aqaba to Amman's Queen Alia airport (JD48). Buy tickets online, at the airport 
or at RJ's city office near Dream Mall. By the time you read this, Royal Falcon 
(T06 556 1652, Wwww.royalfalcon.com.jo) may also be flying to Amman.
To Israel
The Wadi Araba border crossing into Israel (Sun-Thurs 6.30am-8pm, Fri & 
Sat 8am-8pm) - also known as the "Southern Crossing" - is signposted off the 
Wadi Araba highway about 5km north of Aqaba. Taxis (marked "Southern Pass 
Service") run from Aqaba bus station to the border for JD3 per person, or 
JD12 for the whole car. There's a JD5 departure tax and most nationalities 
are issued with free Israeli visas on arrival. A taxi into Eilat is about NIS40 - or 
walk from the border about 500m to the Kibbutz Elot bus stop on the main 
road, from where you can flag down a bus for the last couple of kilometres into 
town. Note that during the Jewish shabbat - effectively from Friday 2pm until 
Saturday dusk - all Israeli public transport and many services shut down. Egged 
buses (Wwww.egged.com) depart Eilat frequently for Tel Aviv and Jerusalem 
(both 5hr; NIS70).
To Egypt
There are two ferry services from Aqaba to Egypt. Arab Bridge Maritime (T03
209 2000, Wwww.abmaritime.com.jo) runs boats to Nuweiba, 70km southwest 
of Aqaba - though their timetable is notoriously unreliable (it can change from 
month to month) and you should expect lengthy delays: six hours or more is 
not uncommon. Check details in person at their city-centre office (see map 
p.340). At the time of writing a catamaran departs daily at 1pm (1hr; economy 
JD50; first class JD64) and a slow ferry departs daily at midnight (JD46; 3hr). 
Aqaba's passenger terminal lies 9km south of town, reached by serveece 
(JD1.50pp) or taxi (JD6). There's a departure tax of JD5. Although it's possible 
to get an Egyptian visa on the boat, getting one ahead of time will save endless 
bureaucratic chaos; the consulate in Aqaba (see opposite) offers straightforward 
on-the-spot service. At Nuweiba port, taxi-drivers do the run into town 
(8km) for about LE20. Alternatively beside the port is Nuweiba's main bus 
station, with buses five times a day to Cairo (via Taba; 8hr; LE55) and three 
times a day south to Dahab (1hr; LE11) and Sharm (3hr; LE20), interspersed 
with very negotiable serveeces. Check with Arab Bridge for details of extra 
boats in peak season (during summer, at the end of Ramadan, and around the 
hajj and Eid al-Adha).
Sindbad (T03 205 0077 or 079 555 6076, Wwww.sindbadjo.com) runs a 
ferry to the marina at Taba Heights, 70km north of Nuweiba. It's designed 
as the return leg of a cruise for people staying in Taba's luxury hotels, but 
qualifies as hassle-free passenger transport. Boats depart from the marina at Tala 
Bay, 15km south of Aqaba (taxi about JD10), daily at around 6.30 and 7.30pm 
- plus there's a boat most days at about 1-2pm from a jetty at the giant flagpole 
in central Aqaba. The one-way fare is about JD50, which includes taxes and 
marina fees; journey time is half an hour. It is essential to book at least one day 
in advance, and advisable to also hold an Egyptian visa before you travel. Taba

Heights has several luxury hotels (cheapest is El Wekala; Wwww.threecorners
.com; 6), or you could flag down transport heading north into Taba or south 
to Nuweiba.
It's cheaper and often easier to go overland through the Israeli resort of Eilat 
(total journey time about 2-3hr), but avoid crossing during the Jewish shabbat
(between about 2pm Friday and 8pm Saturday), when it's difficult to find 
transport in Israel. Once you're inside Israel (see above for details), a combination 
of walking and city buses will get you to the Egyptian border (hagvul hamitzri in 
Hebrew), 6km south of Eilat, but it's easier to take a taxi (around NIS80-100). 
The Eilat-Taba border is open 24 hours a day - there's an Israeli departure tax 
of NIS90 and an Egyptian entry tax of US$8 - but you can only get a Sinai visa 
here (free), valid solely for the coast between Taba and Sharm el-Sheikh: if you 
want to travel on to Cairo, you must hold a full Egyptian visa in advance. From 
Taba's bus station, buses run to destinations including Sharm (2 daily; 4hr; LE27) 
and Cairo (4 daily; 7hr; LE55). Serveeces charge much more. Note that the 
passport stamps you pick up overlanding through Israel will disqualify you from 
subsequently entering Syria and many other Middle Eastern countries.

The Wadi Araba road: Aqaba-Dead Sea
The road running due north from Aqaba along the floor of the vast Wadi 
Araba is much overlooked as a fast route back to the Dead Sea and Amman, 
but if you have your own transport this is much preferable to the tedious Desert 
Highway via Ma'an. However, it's a long drive: 280km from Aqaba to the Dead 
Sea hotels, passing through only a few villages on the way. The only public 
transport that lets you hop on or off are minibuses between Aqaba and Tafileh 
or Karak.
There are few sights other than the scenery. In the southern parts, expect 
sandy desert, isolated acacia trees and rolling dunes, backed by giant mountains. 
Local bedouin tend to allow their camels to graze freely beside the road. At 
some points, the border fence with Israel is beside the road: traffic on the 
mirror-image Israeli highway on the other side is clearly visible, as are the 
irrigated fields cultivated by a string of desert kibbutzes.

At GHARANDAL, 70km north of Aqaba, the Chinese company who built 
this road left behind a pagoda as a memento. Some 40km further, there's the 
welcome sight of the Beir Mathkoor Café (T03 206 3650), a refreshment stop
and petrol station open all hours. Shortly after, a sign points off the road to BIR
MATHKOOR, which was the westernmost caravan suburb of Petra, tucked 
away in the mountains to the east of the road (you can spot the white shrine 
atop Jebel Haroun from here). The Nabatean ruins, however, are likely to inspire 
only the most enthusiastic of archeologists.
About 130km north of Aqaba, a turn to Fidan and QURAYQIRA is also 
signposted for the RSCN's Wilderness Lodge at FEYNAN, located at the 
western end of the Dana Nature Reserve. See p.255 for details of spending a 
night here. The turn-off is passable in an ordinary car for 17km to Qurayqira 
village itself (pronounced "graygra") and for another 5km to Rashaydeh village 
- but there the road runs out. You'll need a 4x4 - or a lift from a local - for the 
extra 10km across the desert to the lodge.
Beyond the Qurayqira turning, another gently rising 35km of highway brings 
you to the edge of a scarp with the whole of the Dead Sea plain stretching in 
front. The small agricultural settlement of FIFA is at the bottom of the slope, 
with a signed turn-off climbing east into the mountains to Tafileh (see p.249).
The stretch from Fifa northwards past SAFI is covered on p.137 as the Dead
Sea road, which leads eventually to Amman.

History
T
he history of Jordan is a history of occupation. Never the seat of an 
empire, the country - known in the past as "Transjordan" (ie the land 
across the Jordan river) - has been tramped by foreign armies and 
merchants since the pharaohs. Until independence in the mid-twentieth 
century, the indigenous people, chiefly bedouin tribes, tended to live under the 
nominal - and often ineffectual - rule of governors sent from Transjordan's 
more powerful neighbours.
Only relatively small parts of the country - the well-watered northern 
highlands and Jordan Valley - have ever been able to support large populations. 
Since prehistoric times, huge tracts of land to the south and east have received 
very little rainfall and have no rivers; only tiny populations of nomadic or semi-
nomadic bedouin have been able to live there. Thus the history of Jordan 
revolves largely around events in the fertile north and west. The history of the 
desert survives only in the culture and oral traditions of the bedouin 
themselves.
The Stone Age: up to 3200 BC
During the Paleolithic period (c.500,000-17,000 BC), Jordan's climate was a 
good deal wetter than it is today, and what is now desert was then semi-fertile 
savannah. The local population of hunter-gatherer hominids, as well as foraging 
for wild plants, preyed upon the area's native big game, which included lions, 
elephants, bears and gazelle. Flint and stone handaxes from this time have been 
found all over the country, most significantly in enormous quantities at the 
Azraq oasis in the eastern desert.
Some time around 17,000 BC, at the beginning of the Epipaleolithic period, 
major changes took place in Transjordan. The previously nomadic hunter-
gatherers began to make seasonal camps, broadened their diet to include small 
mammals and - most importantly - learnt how to domesticate goats and 
cultivate some wild grains. These new proto-farmers, who used complex tools 
such as sickles and pestles and mortars, have left evidence of their building work 
all over Jordan: small, circular enclosures and huts solidly built with subterranean 
foundations.
From about 8500 BC onwards, during the Neolithic period, three profound 
shifts altered the pattern of life. First, responding to the introduction of new 
food sources from agriculture and animal husbandry, people began to opt for 
the certainties of community life, establishing permanent villages such as at 
Baydha, near Petra. The large Neolithic settlement at Ain Ghazal, northeast 
of Amman, was made up of many rectangular, multi-roomed houses, some with 
plastered floors. From the discovery here and across the region of skulls covered 
with plaster, their eye sockets stuffed with bitumen, it seems that one aspect of 
village life was veneration - or even worship - of the dead. The oldest statues 
in the world, dating from around 6000 BC, were uncovered at Ain Ghazal: one-
metre-high androgynous figures with huge, painted eyes, now on display in 
Amman.
A second shift resulted from changing weather patterns: as temperatures rose, 
the eastern savannah dried out and became virtually uninhabitable. Desertifica-
tion marked a clear distinction between Transjordan's arid east and fertile west, 
forcing most people to congregate in the western areas that, today, still hold the 
greater population.
CONTEXTS | History

360
But the most important innovation of Neolithic times was the discovery of 
how to make pottery. Around 5000 BC, potters arrived in Transjordan from 
the more advanced civilizations of Mesopotamia (in modern Iraq). By 4000 BC 
or so, during the Chalcolithic period, copper had been smelted for the first 
time for use in fashioning hooks, axes and arrowheads, and the new metal began 
to be used in conjunction with pottery and flint-working to considerably 
improve the quality of life. People slowly began to turn away from subsistence 
hunting towards planned cultivation: olives, lentils, dates, barley and wheat were 
all common, as was sheep- and goat-breeding. The area's principal copper 
deposits were at Faynan in Wadi Araba, but the largest Chalcolithic village 
discovered in Jordan is at Teleilat Ghassul in the Jordan Valley, where mud-
brick houses with roofs of wood, mud and reeds were constructed around large 
courtyards. Here, pots were decorated and of good quality, and woven baskets 
were sturdy. From the evidence of the village's mysterious murals of masked 
figures, stars and geometric motifs, it seems that Ghassulian women decorated 
themselves with necklaces of shells and stones, while men took pride in 
tattoos.
The Bronze Age: 3200-1200 BC
Towns from the Early Bronze Age (c.3200-1950 BC), although still relying 
on copper ("Bronze Age" is a misnomer from the early days of archeology), 
often included strong defensive fortifications, probably to keep the marauding 
nomadic tribes of the open countryside away. The new technology of water 
management led to collection and some storage of supply against drier times. 
New customs of burial also developed, sometimes involving the digging of 
deep shaft tombs: at Bab adh-Dhraa on the Dead Sea, archeologists have 
uncovered over twenty thousand such shafts, perhaps containing up to a quarter 
of a million corpses in total. Other burial customs - possibly brought from 
Syria or Anatolia - involved the construction of dolmens (two or more stone 
slabs standing side by side, capped by another slab), which can be found 
throughout the Jordanian countryside.
Elsewhere in the region at this time, the extraordinary innovation of writing 
was leading to the development of highly sophisticated civilizations. To the 
south, Egypt was unified into one kingdom, while to the north and east, 
Anatolia and Mesopotamia saw the rise of equally complex urbanized cultures. 
Occupying the area midway between the three, the simpler people of the 
Levant, who wouldn't start to use writing for another millennium or so, fell into 
the role of merchant middlemen. The first significant commerce began to flow 
between the great powers.
Around 2300 BC, many of the fortified towns in Transjordan were destroyed, 
although there is some controversy as to whether this was due to conquest by 
a new people, the Amorites, or simply an earthquake. A decrease in rainfall levels 
coupled with a general rise in temperature almost certainly played its part, too.
The Middle Bronze Age (c.1950-1550 BC) saw trade between Egypt, 
Arabia and the city-states of Syria and Palestine continuing to flow through 
Transjordan, generating wealth and facilitating the spread of ideas and culture. 
It was during this period that artisans mixed copper with tin for the first time; 
the resulting metal, bronze, allowed much harder and more durable tools and 
weapons to be made than before. Transjordanian towns such as Amman, Irbid 
and Pella (as well as Jericho, on the western bank of the river) built massive, 
banked earth ramparts, implying a need for security - as borne out by the 
eighteenth-century BC conquests of the Hyksos who overran much of the 
CONTEXTS | History

361
Levant. Probably nomadic herders from Central Asia, the Hyksos interrupted 
the steady indigenous cultural growth of Transjordan, replacing it with new, 
foreign elements. As well as importing a more graceful and technically accom-
plished style of pottery, they also introduced both horses and chariots to the 
Middle East.
Following the expulsion of the Hyksos around 1550 BC by the Egyptian 
Seventeenth Dynasty, Transjordan - and the rest of the Levant - saw an expansion 
of Egyptian influence during the Late Bronze Age (c.1550-1200 BC), 
especially under Pharaoh Tuthmosis III. Despite conflict further north, occupied 
Transjordan remained relatively peaceful and prosperous, and the presence of 
pottery from Mycenaean Greece and Cyprus indicates strong trade links.
By 1200 BC, however, the peace and prosperity of the eastern Mediterranean 
had been shattered, probably by the arrival of unknown invaders collectively 
termed "Peoples of the Sea", one group of whom, the Philistines, settled 
around Gaza (giving rise to the name Palestine). The principal cities of Greece 
and Cyprus fell to these foreigners, the Hittite Empire in Anatolia collapsed, 
wealthy city-states in Syria were razed and the Egyptian occupiers of Trans-
jordan retreated to face the onslaught at home. In addition, events surrounding 
a group of tribes known as the Israelites - about which ample, if contradictory, 
records survive - began to alter the power balance in Transjordan and Palestine.
Biblical accounts of the Bronze Age
Genesis records that Abram, a native of the city of Ur - most likely in 
modern Iraq - travelled at some time probably well before 2000 BC with 
his wife and extended family to Canaan (Palestine). After some years, the 
land - already home to existing tribes of Canaanites and others - was unable 
to support so many people, and bickering ensued between Abram's tribe and 
that of his nephew Lot. Abram offered a separation: Lot would be given the 
choice of taking his tribe and flocks either east or west of the River Jordan, 
and whichever direction he chose, Abram and his tribe would go the other 
way. Lot chose to go east and pitched his tents at the southeastern corner of 
the Dead Sea. Abram went west and eventually settled near Hebron, 
meanwhile having a vision of God granting him in perpetuity the land that 
Lot had spurned.
After the adaptation of Abram's name to Abraham following another vision, 
Lot's home city of Sodom - and others nearby - were destroyed. The only 
survivors were Lot and his two daughters, who lived for a time in a cave in the 
desert. Fearful that their tribe would die out since no man had escaped with 
them other than their father, the elder of Lot's two daughters hatched a plan to 
get their father so drunk he wouldn't be able to tell who they were, whereupon 
they would seduce him and thus preserve the family. Everything worked to plan 
and both daughters gave birth to sons; the elder named her child Moab, and 
the younger Ben-Ammi, or "father of Ammon".
Meanwhile Abraham had had two sons, the first - Ishmael - by his Egyptian 
mistress Hagar, and the second - Isaac - by his wife Sarah. On Sarah's insist-
ence, Hagar and Ishmael were banished to the desert, and the biblical record 
concentrates on Isaac's two sons, Esau and Jacob. (The Quran, though, concen-
trates on Ishmael, who had twelve children and died at the age of 137; Muslims 
and especially Arabs view him as their forebear. The hajj pilgrimage centres on 
commemoration of Hagar and Ishmael's banishment.) Jacob persuaded Esau to 
sell his inheritance and, by dint of trickery, also gained the blessing of his father 
to rule over his brother. The two then separated, Jacob fleeing to an uncle's 
house and after a series of visions changing his name to Israel (which means 
CONTEXTS | History

362
"he who wrestled with God"). Esau married into Ishmael's family and settled 
in the southern part of Transjordan, known as Edom. Its southern neighbour 
Midian (modern Hejaz), and its northern neighbours Moab and Ammon, as 
well as Edom itself, were all established kingdoms by soon after 2000 BC.
The Bible makes no further mention of Transjordan until the Exodus, which 
occurred several centuries after Esau. The most accepted chronology places it 
during the reign of Pharaoh Merneptah (c.1236-1217 BC), but it may have 
been over two centuries earlier. The Book of Numbers records that, after 
expulsion from Egypt and several generations of wandering in the Sinai, the 
Israelites, an extended group of twelve related tribes descended from Abraham's 
grandson, Israel, arrived in the southern Palestinian desert near Aqaba, on a 
journey towards the lands west of the Jordan that had been granted by God to 
the tribal patriarch Abraham. The Israelite sheikh Moses and his brother Aaron 
had a vision from God instructing them to speak to a rock to produce water for 
their tribes; Moses, though, struck the rock, and for this transgression both he 
and his brother were denied future entry to the Promised Land.
After Aaron's death on Mount Hor (possibly Jebel Haroun near Petra), the 
Israelites apparently followed the route of the present Desert Highway north-
wards. A little way north of modern Qatraneh, the Israelites defeated the 
Amorites in battle and destroyed their cities, including Hesban, Dhiban and 
Madaba. They proceeded north to Dera'a (just over the modern Syrian border), 
defeated King Og and returned to make camp in "the plain of Moab" opposite 
Jericho, probably near modern Shuneh al-Janubiyyeh. Alarmed at the presence 
of such powerful newcomers on his borders, the king of Moab made a military 
pact with the kings of Midian, but after a seer prophesied only victory for the 
Israelites, the combined Moabite-Midianite forces lost heart, and were attacked 
and routed. Three Israelite tribes occupied Transjordan from Dhiban as far north 
as Gilead (the hills around modern Jerash) and the Golan Heights. Moses then 
had several visions and, sometime probably around 1200 BC, at the age of 120, 
died on Mount Nebo near Madaba. Soon afterwards, his successor Joshua led 
the Israelite tribes across the Jordan into the Promised Land.
The Iron Age: 1200-332 BC
With the bulk of the Israelite forces safely on the other side of the Jordan, the 
years after 1200 BC saw a consolidation and development of the Transjordanian 
kingdoms of Ammon, Moab and Edom, all three of which lay on the lucrative 
Arabian-Syrian trade route for gold, spices and other precious goods.
By about 1000 BC the Israelites were strong enough to declare a united 
Kingdom of Israel; under King David, they seized control of virtually the 
entire Levant and won several victories in Transjordan. Edom managed to regain 
some independence following David's death in 960 BC, but it wasn't until 
David's son Solomon died some thirty years later that the Israelite empire fell. 
The last vestiges of Israelite control in Transjordan were erased during the mid-
ninth century BC, partly by the efforts of Mesha, apparently king of Moab, who 
recorded his victories on the "Mesha Stele" (see p.240), a basalt stone set up 
in the Moabite capital, Dhiban. To the north, Ammon, centred on modern 
Amman, prospered, while to the south, Edom had developed skill in mining and 
smelting copper and had major settlements near Busayrah, Petra and Aqaba, 
although much of the Edomite population may have been nomadic or 
semi-nomadic.
By the mid-eighth century BC Assyrian forces had captured Damascus and 
parts of Israel. It was only by paying tribute that Ammon, Moab and Edom 
CONTEXTS | History

363
managed to retain their independence and continue to exploit the north-south 
flow of trade.
Barely a century later, in 612 BC, the Assyrians were themselves defeated by 
an alliance of Medes (from modern Iran) and Babylonians (from Iraq); the 
latter then took control in the Levant, limiting the independence of the Trans-
jordanian kingdoms and, in 587 BC, destroying Jerusalem and deporting 
thousands of Jews. Chaotic Babylonian rule was then overrun by the Persian 
Empire, the largest yet seen in the region. The Persians released the Jews from 
captivity in Babylon and permitted them to rebuild their temple at Jerusalem. 
The indignant Ammonites and Moabites took this to be a declaration of sover-
eignty and attacked, only to be repulsed by the direct intervention of the 
Persian leadership.
Two centuries of relatively stable Persian rule were brought to a swift end by 
the military adventures of the Greek general known as Alexander the Great. 
In 333 BC, at the age of 21, he defeated the Persian army in southeastern Turkey 
and proceeded to conquer the entire Levant and Egypt before heading east. At 
his death in Babylon in 323 BC, Alexander controlled an empire stretching 
from Greece to India.
The Greeks and the Nabateans: 332-64 BC
Alexander's conquest of the Persian capital Persepolis in 332 BC confirmed 
Hellenistic control over the formerly Persian lands of the Levant, and ushered 
in a period of dominance over Transjordan by Alexander's successors that lasted 
for three centuries. On Alexander's death, his generals Seleucus and Ptolemy 
divided the eastern part of his empire between them: Palestine, Transjordan and 
southern Syria went to Ptolemy, while Seleucus took northern Syria and 
Mesopotamia. Bitter struggles for the upper hand ensued, with much of Trans-
jordan caught in the crossfire. After more than a century of fighting, the 
Seleucids finally wrested Transjordan away from the Ptolemies in 198 BC. 
Meanwhile, many new and rebuilt Transjordanian cities had been flourishing, 
including Philadelphia (Amman), Gerasa (Jerash), Pella and Gadara (Umm Qais) 
- though virtually the only Hellenistic monument to survive today is a lone 
palace in the countryside west of Amman, Qasr al-Abd.
Long before these events, and possibly as early as the sixth century BC, a 
nomadic tribe of Arabs had wandered out of the deserts to the south and taken 
up residence in and around Edom. Slowly these Nabateans had abandoned 
their nomadic ways and founded a number of settlements in southern Trans-
jordan, northern Arabia and the Naqab (Negev) desert of modern Israel, 
probably using their position to plunder the caravans heading out of Arabia 
loaded with luxury goods. The Roman historian Diodorus Siculus, writing 
much later, describes "Arabs who are called Nabatei" occupying Petra around 
312 BC (for more on Petra's history, see p.261). The Nabateans - who had 
switched from plundering caravans to providing them with safe passage - 
managed to remain largely independent throughout the Seleucid-Ptolemaic 
power battles.
With the Seleucid victory of 198 BC, trade again prospered in Transjordan and 
the Nabateans expanded their realm, absorbing many Hellenistic influences 
which worked their way into the art and architecture of Petra. By 150 BC - 
co-existing alongside Seleucid rule in western Transjordan - the independent 
Kingdom of Nabatea extended along a strip of eastern Transjordan as far 
north as the Hawran, and south into the Hejaz. The Nabateans were accumu-
lating vast profits from trade across the Middle East in everything from Indian

364
silks and spices to Dead Sea bitumen and, most importantly, a monopoly over 
trade in frankincense and myrrh. Both were central in religious ceremonies 
throughout the West and both were produced only in southern Arabia; transport 
overland from the Arabian coast terminated at the sole taxation and interna-
tional distribution centre at Petra.
Meanwhile riots were breaking out in Judea against Hellenistic rule. In three 
successive years - 167 to 165 BC - Jewish rebels defeated the Greek army four 
times. The Jewish leader Judas Maccabeus then invaded northern Transjordan. 
Less than a century later, Judas's successor occupied the whole of Transjordan as 
far south as Wadi Hasa, with the Nabatean kingdom - by now extended to 
Damascus but still confined only to a slice of the country east of the King's 
Highway - remaining independent. With nothing appearing likely to put a stop 
to the growth of Nabatean wealth and influence, and faced by an increasingly 
unstable political situation, the generals of Rome decided that the time had 
come to impose some law and order.
Rome and the Nabateans: 64 BC-324 AD
In 64 BC, the Roman general Pompey took Damascus and ordered Nabatean 
forces to pull back from the city. After proceeding to annex most of the region, 
Pompey sent a force to Petra to subdue the Nabateans, but the Nabatean king 
was able easily to repulse the attack and dip into his treasury to pay the Romans 
off.
Pompey turned his attention elsewhere. The group of Hellenized northern 
Transjordanian cities that included Gerasa, Gadara, Philadelphia and Pella had 
been badly damaged under the Jewish occupation; Pompey restored their infra-
structure and granted them some local autonomy. With shared cultural and 
economic ties, these cities - in a region of Transjordan known as the Decapolis
("Ten Cities"; see p.156) - agreed to pay taxes to the Romans and so retained 
independence.
In 44 BC, Julius Caesar was assassinated in Rome. The Parthians - based in 
Mesopotamia and Persia - took the chance to attack, and the Nabateans sided 
with them; following Rome's reassertion of its power, the Nabatean king was 
forced to dip into his treasury again to placate the generals. The local Roman 
placeman, Herod the Great, twice attacked the Nabateans to ensure consistent 
payments. By the time of Herod's death in 4 BC, Rome was in control of the 
region, with Transjordan divided into three spheres of influence: to the north, 
the Decapolis remained independent; Palestinian Jewish puppet-kings ruled 
central Transjordan (although Philadelphia remained part of the Decapolis); and 
the south comprised the rump Kingdom of Nabatea, still nominally independent, 
though coming under increasing pressure to submit to Rome.
Herod the Great's successor, Herod Antipas, married a daughter of the 
Nabatean king Aretas IV, but soon afterwards divorced her, and married his 
brother's wife instead. Unable to ignore such an insult, Aretas sent an army 
against Herod and won, but showed magnanimity in withdrawing peacefully. A 
local holy man, John the Baptist, condemned Herod's incestuous marriage, was 
imprisoned at the royal palace at Machaerus and, at the behest of Herod's step-
daughter Salome, beheaded.
Jewish uprisings in Palestine during the mid-first century AD gave a chance for 
the Nabateans to weigh in militarily and so restore amicable relations with Rome. 
The Nabatean king was personally present at the Roman capture of Jerusalem in 
70 AD. Many Palestinian Jewish rebels sought refuge at Machaerus, but the 
Roman army razed the palace in 72 AD and slaughtered everyone inside.

By this stage it was clear to the Nabateans that their days of independence 
were numbered. A new trading centre far to the north, Palmyra - positioned 
on Roman-sponsored routes that were growing in popularity - was chipping 
away at Petra's business, and the Nabatean king Rabbel II, seeing Roman 
dominance all around, almost certainly made a deal permitting the Romans to 
annex the Nabatean lands peacefully. In 106, on Rabbel's death, the whole of 
Transjordan - with the exception of the Decapolis - was incorporated into the

new Roman Province of Arabia, under the Emperor Trajan, with a new 
capital at Bosra, in Syria.
From Trajan to Constantine: 106-324 AD
Roman city planners, engineers and construction workers moved into Trans-
jordan. Large forts were built near Karak, Petra and in the north to house the 
massed legions; Petra itself, along with Philadelphia, Gerasa, Gadara and other 
cities, was renovated and Romanized; and, by 114 AD, a new fortified road - 
the Via Nova Traiana - was in place, running from Bosra right the way 
through Transjordan to the Red Sea at Aila (Aqaba). Trajan's successor, Hadrian, 
paid the province a visit in 130, staying in Gerasa, by this time one of the most 
splendid of Rome's provincial cities. During the second and third centuries, 
Transjordan gained new sophistication under the Romans, and prosperity rose 
to an unprecedented level. In 199, the Emperor Septimius Severus toured the 
province with his Syrian wife; although many overland trade routes from Arabia 
had been diverted to Palmyra and seaborne trade along the Red Sea was flour-
ishing, Petra was still important enough to merit a visit. It was around this time 
that Azraq, at the head of a major route to and from the Arabian peninsula, 
was fortified for the first time.
Nonetheless, the desert fringes of the empire remained open to infiltration, 
and in 260, Persian Sassanians invaded from the north. Six years later, the 
Roman military commander, based in Palmyra, was murdered, precipitating a 
rebellion throughout Syria led by a local queen, Zenobia. The situation was 
perilous enough to force the Emperor Diocletian (284-305) to take drastic 
measures. Retaining overall command from his base in Turkey, Diocletian split 
the empire into eastern and western administrations under separate emperors, 
and then proceeded to strengthen the infrastructure of the eastern fringes, 
building forts and new roads, among them the Strata Diocletiana linking
Azraq with Damascus. Meanwhile, with Palmyra's predominance annulled 
through its association with rebellion, trade through Transjordan once again 
began to flourish, and the Red Sea port of Aila took on a new importance.
A new force was also beginning to make itself felt. The influence of Christi-
anity went much deeper than the extent of its practice (by a mere fourteen 
percent or so of the empire's population) might show. The Emperor Constantine 
had already converted by 324 when he made Christianity the official religion of 
the eastern empire. Six years later, he confirmed the eclipse of Rome by founding 
a new Christian imperial capital - Constantinople (modern Istanbul).
The Byzantine period: 324-636
The Byzantine period - so named because Constantinople had been built 
over the ancient Greek colony of Byzantium - saw long-lived Roman institu-
tions coexisting with the new Christian faith, which flourished within a 
broadly Greek culture. Transjordan experienced a steady growth of population 
coupled with energetic construction projects and important artistic 
development.
Constantine's mother, Helena, started a trend of pilgrimage by journeying 
to Jerusalem in 326. It was around this time that the first church on Mount 
Nebo was built to commemorate Moses' death, and the area around Nebo and 
Madaba became the focus for pilgrimage in Transjordan. Following the final 
divorce between Rome and Constantinople in 395, many churches were built, 
often on the foundations of Roman temples and often decorated with ornate 
mosaics. Madaba, in particular, was a flourishing centre for mosaicists, especially 
CONTEXTS | History

367
during the reign of Justinian (527-65). Church building and mosaic art in 
Transjordan (see p.229) entered a golden age.
Twin disasters were to bring both artistic development and, indirectly, the 
empire itself to an end. The first was plague, which struck Transjordan during 
Justinian's reign and wiped out much of the population. A far more sustained 
threat came from the Persian Sassanians, who, in the sixth century, launched 
a series of raids against the Euphrates frontier, breaking through to sack 
Antioch in 540. There followed over eighty years of titanic, but inconclusive, 
struggle in Syria between Byzantium and Persia - Transjordan remaining quiet 
throughout - which was only ended by the Emperor Heraclius' recapture of 
Syria in 628.
During the struggles (and unknown to either combatant), far to the south 
an Arab holy man named Muhammad had been gathering around himself a 
large band of followers following a series of divine visions. Initial sorties 
northwards had won over a few desert tribes but the Muslims, as they styled 
themselves, lost their first battle with Byzantium, near Karak in 629. 
Muhammad himself died in Mecca in 632, but his armies, led by Abu Bakr, 
the first caliph ("successor"), and fired by the zeal of a new religion, pushed 
northwards again, seizing Damascus from Heraclius in 635. On the banks of 
the River Yarmouk the following year, they defeated a Byzantine army 
exhausted from decades of war.
The early caliphs of Islam: 636-1250
After the Yarmouk victory, it took the Muslim armies barely ten years to 
dismantle Byzantine control over the Levant, although the Byzantine Empire 
itself limped on for another eight hundred years. By 656, the whole of Persia 
and the Middle East was ruled from the Muslim capital at Medina. That year, 
the third caliph, Othman, was murdered. When his successor, Ali, dismissed 
many of Othman's appointees - including Muawiya, governor of Syria - civil 
war broke out among the Muslims, brought to an end only by negotiations 
held probably at Udhruh near Petra in 659. Ali was subsequently assassinated, 
and Muawiya, a member of the Umayyad clan, was acclaimed caliph in 661. 
This marked a schism in Islam, which persists today, between the Sunnis - the 
orthodox majority who accept the Umayyad succession - and the minority 
Shi'ites, who believe the succession should have passed instead to Ali, a relative 
of Muhammad's, and his descendants.
The Umayyads: 661-750
Muawiya's first decision was to relocate the Muslim capital away from Arabia to 
the vibrant metropolis of Damascus. At one stroke, Transjordan was transformed: 
not only was it on the direct pilgrimage route between the imperial capital and 
the holy sites in Mecca and Medina, but it also suddenly lay at the heart of a 
rapidly expanding empire, which, at its fullest extent, reached from India 
virtually to the Pyrenees. The Umayyad caliphs began a vigorous campaign of 
monument-building throughout the Levant, which included both the Dome of 
the Rock in Jerusalem and the Great Mosque of Damascus. At heart, however, 
they were desert people, and their most enduring legacy to Transjordan is a 
series of buildings in the eastern desert, now known as the "Desert Castles": 
some, such as Qasr Harraneh, were places where the caliphs could meet with 
the bedouin tribes of the area, while others - Qusayr Amra, Qasr Mushatta
- were lavish country mansions or hunting lodges. Motivated less by adherence 
to Islamic orthodoxy than by older Arab notions of honour, loyalty and rule by 
CONTEXTS | History

368
negotiation, the Umayyads had a lively aesthetic sense, valuing intellectual 
curiosity, poetry and wine in roughly equal quantities. Christianity was widely 
tolerated, and churches were still being built in Transjordan up to the middle of 
the eighth century.
Abbasids and Fatimids: 750-1097
Followers of stricter interpretations of Islam eventually gained the upper hand, 
possibly aided by a devastating earthquake which struck the region in 749. A 
year later, Damascus fell to a new dynasty, the Abbasids, who shifted the 
Muslim capital eastwards to Baghdad, a symbolic move embodying a rejection 
of the liberal Umayyad spirit in preference for more strait-laced Mesopotamian 
methods. Transjordan - instantly reduced to a provincial backwater - fell into 
obscurity.
During the ninth century, internal dissent whittled away at the power of the 
Abbasid caliphate, and by 969 a rival, Shi'ite-derived caliphate had been 
proclaimed in Cairo by the Tunisian Fatimid dynasty, who took control of 
Palestine, Transjordan and southern Syria soon after, destroying many churches 
and harassing Christian pilgrims. In 1037, Seljuk Turks took power in Baghdad 
and within fifty years had defeated both the Fatimids and the Byzantines to 
regain Transjordan for orthodox Islam.
These tides of Muslim conquest and reconquest sweeping the Holy Land, 
coupled with the anti-Christian feeling aroused by the Fatimids and a 
Byzantine request for military aid against the Seljuks, didn't go unnoticed in 
the West. In 1095 Pope Urban II, speaking in France, launched an appeal for a 
European force to intervene in the chaos in the Middle East, to restore 
Christian rule in Palestine and, above all, to liberate Jerusalem. This holy war 
was termed a crusade.
Crusaders and Ayyubids: 1097-1250
In 1097, a 100,000-strong Christian army - comprising seasoned troops and 
peasant rabble alike - arrived at Constantinople. Two years later, they seized 
Jerusalem, slaughtering every man, woman and child in the city. Within forty 
years, there was a strip of Crusader-held territory running from southern 
Turkey to the Red Sea, part of it incorporating the Lordship of Oultre-
jourdain (Transjordan) with its two castle strongholds at Karak and Shobak 
(see also p.244). In 1144, local Muslim forces started to eat into Crusader 
realms in northern Syria, inspiring a wave of strong Muslim resistance to the 
invaders, led after 1176 by a Kurdish officer named Salah ad-Din al-Ayyubi
(or Saladin). Having already disposed of the Fatimids in Cairo (and by doing 
so uniting the Muslim world), Salah ad-Din routed the Crusaders on the 
battlefield in 1187 and retook Jerusalem, coastal Palestine and Transjordan. 
After his death in 1193, his dynasty, the Ayyubids, ruled the Muslim forces 
from their power base in Cairo. Waves of Crusaders nonetheless continued to 
arrive from Europe over the next decades, and rule of Levantine coastal areas 
shifted to and fro.
Mamlukes and Ottomans: 1250-1915
The Ayyubids came to rely for their military strength upon a band of highly 
disciplined and trained slave-troops, known as "the owned ones". Most of these 
Mamlukes were Turks or Caucasians from southern Russia who had been 
bought at market. Once trained, they were given property, goods and women; 
their lack of local tribal allegiance guaranteed loyalty to their master. In 1250, 
CONTEXTS | History

369
however, the worm turned: with the Ayyubid sultan on his deathbed, the 
Mamlukes seized power for themselves.
They soon faced a challenge. In 1258, a Mongol army under Genghis Khan's 
grandson Hulagu destroyed Baghdad and swept westward through Transjordan 
to Galilee, where they were halted by a Mamluke army. The victorious general, 
Baybars, claimed the title of sultan and proceeded to eject the last remaining 
Crusaders from the Levant.
During the fourteenth century, the Mamluke unification of Syria and Egypt 
provided some peace for the embattled Transjordanian population, who 
continued to facilitate north-south commerce and provide shelter to Muslim 
pilgrims. Another Mongol invasion in 1400 under Tamerlane overran much of 
Syria; Mamluke finances - which relied on the Red Sea shipping trade - were 
further undermined by the Portuguese discovery of a new sea route around 
Africa to India.
Meanwhile, in northwestern Turkey a new dynasty had been gathering power, 
and, in 1453, these Ottomans seized Constantinople, erasing what was left of 
the Byzantine Empire. The Ottoman leader Selim the Grim occupied
Damascus, Transjordan and Jerusalem in quick succession, eventually suspending 
the last Mamluke sultan from the gallows in Cairo.
Ottoman expansion continued apace (halted only at the gates of Vienna in 
1683) but although imperial architects lavished care and attention on Damascus 
and Jerusalem, Transjordan apart from inns built along the pilgrimage route 
between Damascus and Mecca, was allowed to fall into decline, its people left 
largely to themselves. European merchants based in ports and cities all around 
the region quietly siphoned wealth away from the imperial coffers, and the 
Ottoman Empire crumbled.
In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt, but lost power less than a 
decade later. In the 1830s, the new Egyptian ruler Ibrahim Pasha embarked on 
a military adventure through Transjordan and the Levant which looked poised 
to overthrow Ottoman rule altogether but for the intervention of the British, 
who preferred the presence of a feeble and ineffective sultan to that of an 
enthusiastic and powerful young general. Trade on the Red Sea was revivified 
by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, but the canal itself, which repre-
sented the fastest sea route from Europe to India, remained under sole control 
of the British, who were by now firmly installed in Egypt and nurturing 
imperialist designs on Palestine.
In the 1870s, Russian persecution of Muslims in the Caucasus region east of 
the Black Sea led to waves of refugees arriving in Turkey. The Ottoman authori-
ties dumped them onto ships bound for Levantine ports. These Circassian and 
Chechen farmers settled throughout the region, working their way inland to 
Transjordan and colonizing the long-abandoned ruins at Amman, Jerash and 
elsewhere. In a separate but contemporary development, Russian persecution of 
Jews in modern Poland and Lithuania also created refugees who settled in the 
Levant, this time in Palestine. Jewish activists soon codified a philosophy of 
organized Jewish settlement of Palestine - Zionism.
The decline of the Ottoman Empire: 1900-15
By the turn of the century, there was a spate of railway building around the 
Levant. The French were establishing a network in Syria; the German Berlin-
Baghdad railway had reached Aleppo; and in Palestine, the British had long 
been operating a line from Jaffa to Jerusalem. To counter this European 
influence, and in a bid to bolster his religious authority, the sultan announced 
the construction of an Ottoman-sponsored Hejaz Railway (see p.110), to run 
CONTEXTS | History

370
from Damascus south through Transjordan, terminating at the holy city of 
Mecca. As well as transporting Muslim pilgrims, the sultan also had an eye on 
facilitating the rapid mobilization of Ottoman troops should the Arab nation-
alism that was beginning to stir in the Hejaz come to a head. Transjordanian 
labour was vital in the construction of the line - as were the thick forests 
around Ajloun and Shobak, felled indiscriminately for fuel. By 1908, the track 
had reached Medina, 400km short of Mecca. A coup in Constantinople the 
following year led to seizure of power by secular Turkish nationalists, and the 
railway got no further.
On the outbreak of World War I, the puppet sultan sided with the Germans, 
bringing the Ottoman Empire into conflict with both Britain - eagerly eyeing 
the newly discovered oilfields in Iraq and Persia - and France. Turkification was 
proceeding apace, with a ban on the use of Arabic in schools and offices, arrests 
of Arab nationalist leaders in Damascus and Beirut, and, in 1915, the first of the 
twentieth century's genocides, when over a million Armenians were killed. 
Observing from Cairo, the British conspired on the best way to foment ill-will 
towards Turkish authority into full-scale rebellion. Negotiations with opposi-
tion leaders in Cairo and Damascus to involve Arab forces in a revolt against the 
Turks broke down, but contact with Sharif Hussein, the ruler of Mecca and 
self-styled "King of the Arabs", was more fruitful. Its consequences, and the 
events surrounding the end of World War I, have directly caused almost a 
century of war in the Middle East.
British promises and the Arab Revolt: 1915-18
When the Ottoman Empire entered World War I, the sultan had declared a jihad
(an Islamically sanctioned struggle) against the Western powers. Alarmed at the 
possible repercussions of this in Muslim areas under their control, the British 
were keen to enlist for their side the support of Sharif Hussein, an authoritative 
religious dignitary and direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. In 1915, 
ten letters, known as the McMahon Correspondence, passed between Sir 
Henry McMahon, British High Commissioner in Egypt, and Hussein, in which 
Britain pledged to support Arab claims for independence if Hussein sparked a 
revolt against Turkish authority. Hussein's initial claims were for an independent 
Arab state stretching from Aleppo to the Yemeni coast, but McMahon countered 
this by stating that Arab claims were excluded from three areas: the districts of 
Basra and Baghdad in Iraq (which the British wanted for themselves), the 
Turkish Hatay region around modern Antakya, and - most significantly - 
"portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama 
and Aleppo". Sharif Hussein took this clause to refer to Lebanon, and accepted 
the terms. Confident of British backing, he proclaimed Arab independence on 
June 16, 1916, and declared war on the Turks.
Meanwhile, the British had other ideas. Following negotiation with France 
and Russia, the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement of May 1916 carved up the 
Middle East into areas of colonial dominance, riding roughshod over the 
promises made to Sharif Hussein about Arab independence. Under the 
agreement, France was handed power in southeastern Turkey, Lebanon, Syria 
and northern Iraq, Britain in a belt of land stretching from Haifa to Baghdad 
and the Gulf, with most of Palestine to be administered by an international 
body. The colonial powers told nobody of their plans (Sharif Hussein only 
learnt of them more than a year later).
Also in 1917, in a letter addressed to a leader of Britain's Jewish community, 
which came to be known as the Balfour Declaration, the British Foreign 
CONTEXTS | History

371
Secretary Arthur Balfour wrote that "His Majesty's Government view with 
favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people." 
Hussein had agreed to Arab claims being excluded from the "portion of Syria 
lying to the west of Damascus", and, in an attempt to cover their backs, British 
ministers later claimed - extraordinarily - that this clause referred to Palestine. 
The Balfour Declaration thus completed an astonishing triangle of mutually 
incompatible promises and agreements made by the British government 
between 1915 and 1917. Their consequences are still being suffered today.
The Arab Revolt: 1917-18
Meanwhile, still assuming wholehearted British support, Sharif Hussein - aided 
by two of his sons, Abdullah and Faysal - had launched the Great Arab 
Revolt. A ragtag army of thirty thousand tribesmen quickly seized Mecca and 
Jeddah from Ottoman forces, and, in January 1917, local notables, as well as 
Britain, France and Italy, recognized Sharif Hussein as "King of the Hejaz", 
leader of the first independent Arab state. In its initial stages, the British lent 
their support to the Arab Revolt principally in the form of Second Lieutenant 
T.E. Lawrence, later mythologized as "Lawrence of Arabia" (see p.335). 
Leaving Abdullah to pin down a forlorn Turkish garrison in Medina, Faysal - 
with Lawrence - led an army northwards to the port of Aqaba, a strategic prize 
through which the Arabs would be able to receive weaponry and material 
support from the British Army in Egypt. Ottoman defences in the town, 
protected on two sides by arid mountains, focused all their attention on attack 
from the sea. Holed up to the south, Lawrence instead planned a looping 
overland route through the desert, and with a small force emerged from the 
mountains to launch a surprise attack on the town from the north. The plan 
worked, and Aqaba fell on July 6, 1917.
Faysal's Arab forces then came under the command of the British general 
Allenby, who was leading several divisions from Egypt towards Jerusalem. The 
Arabs and the British worked their way northwards, the Arabs using the old 
castle at Azraq as a base during the winter of 1917-18. After Jerusalem fell to 
the British, the Arab armies skirmished up the Hejaz Railway line, taking 
Ma'an, Karak and Amman. The final assault was launched from Azraq, and on 
October 1, 1918, Faysal and Lawrence entered Damascus, ending Ottoman rule 
in the Levant.
The establishment of the emirate: 1918-23
By now, the French (working to the Sykes-Picot Agreement) had designs on 
Syria and Lebanon, while the British and the Zionist Jews (working to the 
Balfour Declaration) had designs on Palestine. When, in 1920, elected Arab 
delegates to the government in Damascus declared the Levant independent 
under King Faysal, and Iraq independent under King Abdullah (who was 
still in the Hejaz), both Britain and France came out in sharp denunciation. 
Within six weeks, administrative control - termed a "mandate" - over the 
Middle East was awarded by an international conference to the colonial 
powers, forming borders within the Levant for the first time and splitting 
Palestine and Iraq (awarded to Britain) away from Syria and Lebanon 
(handed to France). The French forcibly ejected Faysal from Damascus 
and the British suppressed open rebellion in Iraq. In Mecca, the stunned 
Sharif Hussein realized the extent of the betrayal. "I listened to the faithless 
Englishmen," he muttered to a group of confidants. "I let myself be tempted 
and won over by them."
CONTEXTS | History

372
The position of Transjordan remained unclear for some time. Britain informed 
a meeting of sheikhs at Salt that it favoured self-government for Transjordan, but 
then did little to foster it. Arab discontent was growing at British and French 
duplicity: Abdullah raised an army in Mecca, intending to liberate Damascus 
from the French. He arrived in Ma'an on November 21, 1920, to a rousing 
reception of Transjordanian sheikhs and Arab nationalists.
From Ma'an, Abdullah's path lay through British-held Transjordan, still neither 
part of the Palestine Mandate nor fully autonomous. He proceeded north 
without hindrance, arriving in the village of Amman on March 2, 1921, to 
cheering crowds of mounted tribesmen. Confronted by a fait accompli, but 
obligated to prevent attack on the French from British territory, the new British 
Colonial Secretary Winston Churchill (accompanied by his special adviser T.
E. Lawrence) proposed a separate British mandate to be established in Trans-
jordan; in exchange for Abdullah's abdication of the throne of Iraq in favour of 
Faysal, Britain would offer Abdullah the temporary title of Emir (Prince) of 
Transjordan, until "some accommodation" could be made with the French in 
Damascus. With the knowledge that he was being brought to heel, Abdullah 
attempted to secure the unification of Palestine with Transjordan, but was told 
that Britain had other plans for Palestine which took account of Jewish national 
aspirations. Well aware that Transjordan was the best he and the Arabs were 
likely to get for the moment, Abdullah accepted.
The territory that Abdullah took control of in April 1921 was undeveloped 
and anarchic. The borders drawn by Churchill were more or less arbitrary, 
frequently cutting across tribal areas and grazing grounds. The three existing 
Transjordanian governments - centred in Irbid, Salt and Karak - had virtually 
no authority and were overlaid by a patchwork of unstable local sheikhdoms. 
The population numbered about 230,000, of which over 200,000 were Muslim 
Arabs, the remainder Christian Arabs and Muslim Circassians. Over half were 
fellaheen, or landowning tribal village-dwellers (there were only four towns 
holding more than ten thousand people); a quarter were semi-nomadic bedouin 
concentrated in the north and west, and the rest were fully nomadic, relying on 
their livestock and on raiding the fellaheen, pilgrimage caravans and each other 
for survival. Amman held around 2400 people. Political loyalties were rooted in 
tribalism, and although the population at large tended towards common aims - 
desire for an Arab ruler, hatred of the French for their destruction of the 
Kingdom of Syria, distrust of the British for their double-dealing - they lacked 
a collective voice. When Abdullah arrived, apart from a brief challenge in Salt, 
he was accepted without question as a unifying leader.
For their part, the British wrote Transjordan out of the Palestine Mandate. On 
May 15, 1923, under an Anglo-Jordanian Treaty, the British formally recog-
nized Abdullah as head of the new Emirate of Transjordan, describing it as a 
national state being prepared for full independence under the supervision of the 
British High Commissioner in Jerusalem.
Consolidation of the emirate: 1923-28
In Mecca, Abdullah's father Sharif Hussein was furious at being supplanted. In 
January 1924, he departed for Aqaba, where he ignored his son's, and British, 
authority and started to rule in his own right. It rapidly became apparent, 
though, that his dream of becoming 'king of the Arabs' was in tatters - much as 
was the Arab heartland itself. Syria was controlled by the French, who had 
carved Lebanon from it; Iraq was ruled by one son, Faysal, Transjordan by 
another, Abdullah; Palestine was under the thumb of the British; and late in 
CONTEXTS | History

373
1924 the Hejaz was invaded by a fundamentalist central Arabian tribe led by 
Abd al-Aziz al-Saud, who shortly afterwards established the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia. As a crowning ignominy, the British exiled Hussein to Cyprus, 
where he spent his last days.
Meanwhile, Abdullah set about consolidating power in his newly chosen 
capital of Amman (favoured over the fractious Salt). The 1920s and 1930s saw 
the forging of a cohesive political unity from among the disparate tribes, with 
one of Abdullah's earliest acts being the creation of a centralized security force, 
named the Arab Legion.
Throughout this period, the British guaranteed funding for central govern-
ment, in exchange for British advisers maintaining close contact with 
Abdullah. A pragmatist, as visionary as he was realistic, Abdullah knew that 
the British still called the shots, and that without Britain - specifically, 
without military assistance and money - the emirate could never survive. By 
compromising where necessary, Abdullah maintained progress towards his 
ultimate goal of independence, though his concessions to the British 
tarnished his reputation among Arab nationalists. To assuage growing discon-
tent, Abdullah promulgated the first Transjordanian constitution in 1928. 
A year later, representative elections to a legislative council placed Transjor-
danians in real power for the first time.
With his domestic affairs stable, Abdullah was able to turn his attention further 
afield - specifically to the increasingly fraught situation in Palestine.
Abdullah I and Palestine: 1920-39
Palestine had always had a small native Jewish community, resident for the most 
part in the towns, Arabic-speaking and culturally Palestinian. Since the 1880s, 
however, Jews from central and eastern Europe had been arriving, many of 
them tough-minded nationalistic Zionists, for whom the area was not simply 
a holy land to be shared among religious communities but the rightful national 
homeland of the Jews of the world. As it became obvious that the Balfour 
Declaration was to become official mandate policy in Palestine, a militant 
Arab reaction to Zionism developed, denouncing Britain's perceived right to 
hand the country over to the Jews. In Amman, Abdullah quickly grasped the 
political reality - principally that Britain was in a position to dictate its will and 
that at least some degree of Jewish immigration to Palestine was inevitable. He 
put forward the proposal that if the Jews were prepared to accept the extension 
of his own rule over Palestine, they would be left free to govern themselves 
with all civil rights guaranteed; this would not only secure the Jewish position 
in Palestine with minimum cost to the existing local population, but it would 
also enable Jews to settle in Transjordan, where they could contribute much-
needed money and skills to the country's development.
Amid the increasingly hot-headed politics of the time, such a vision was 
doomed to failure. The Jews wanted more in Palestine than mere political 
autonomy under a Muslim king, and rejected his proposals. Mainstream Arab 
opinion viewed Abdullah's plan as overly concessionary, and from this time on, 
doubts were laid in Palestinian minds as to Abdullah's motives. Reservations 
were fuelled by the leader of the Palestinians, Hajj Amin al-Husseini, Mufti
of Jerusalem. A strict hardliner who refused to compromise an inch with the 
Jews, Hajj Amin led calls for a complete ban on Jewish immigration and land 
purchase, ahead of a declaration of Palestinian independence; he was aided by a 
silent alliance with the British, who had no desire to see Abdullah extending 
influence over a land he wasn't supposed to be ruling. Amman became the focus

for the Palestinian opposition to Hajj Amin, which believed that the only way 
of saving Palestine for the Arabs was to cultivate British goodwill and offer 
limited concessions to the already entrenched Zionist settlers.
Anti-Zionist feeling among Palestinian Arabs exploded into violence in the 
1920s and 1930s, put down with increasing harshness by the British. With the 
coming to power of the Nazis in Germany in 1933, Jewish immigration to 
Palestine increased dramatically, as did Arab attacks on both Jewish and British 
targets. From 1933 onwards, Abdullah began to appoint Palestinians to positions 
of power in Amman, but in such a charged atmosphere, his pragmatism in 
backing both Arab dialogue with the Jews and Arab concessions to the British 
merely fanned Palestinian distrust of his motives. In 1937, a Royal Commis-
sion arrived from London to assess the political situation. The Palestinian 
leadership boycotted the commission's proceedings; under threat of arrest, Hajj 
Amin fled to Lebanon.
The build-up to World War II: 1937-39
With war in Europe looking increasingly likely, Britain attempted to secure its 
position in the Middle East, an area commanding vital land and water routes 
and, most important, harbouring oil. The Royal Commission report of 1937 
recommended partitioning Palestine between Arabs and Jews, but this was 
rejected by the all-or-nothing Palestinian leadership. In May 1939, with war 
imminent, the British suddenly offered a dramatic U-turn. On the table was 
full independence for Palestine after ten years, with severe limitations in the 
meantime on land transfers to Jews and with Jewish immigration permitted 
only subject to Arab approval. The Jews immediately rejected the proposal. In 
Amman, Abdullah hailed it as the best the Palestinian Arabs could ever hope to 
get, but Hajj Amin denounced the deal as a British ploy. The rejectionists won 
the day.
Seeing reason dissipating before him, Abdullah wrote: "The pillars of Zionism 
in Palestine are three: the Balfour promise; the European nations that have 
decided to expel the Jews from their lands; and the extremists among the Arabs 
who do not accept any solution. So behold Palestine, breathing its last."
Independence and the loss of Palestine: 1939-52
World War II had little impact in Transjordan, other than to delay advances 
towards independence. However, Abdullah's Arab Legion served loyally 
alongside the British elsewhere in the Middle East, helping to retake Baghdad 
from the Axis powers in 1941 (which paved the way for the British victory at 
El-Alamein the following year), and helping to eject the Vichy French from 
Syria and Lebanon. Abdullah deserved reward. What he hoped for - as he had 
done for decades - was the throne of a new Greater Syria. However, neither 
the Syrians nor the Lebanese would accept anything less than independence 
now the French had been removed from power; and the king of Saudi Arabia, 
already faced by a strong monarchy in Iraq, had no desire to see another in 
Transjordan (Britain and the United States were both aware by now of the vast 
oil reserves in Saudi Arabia, and were willing to bend over backwards to avoid 
upsetting King Saud). Syria and Lebanon were granted independence, but 
Transjordan remained under British mandate until the 1946 Treaty of 
London, which granted the emirate independence. In May, the Transjordanian 
cabinet switched Abdullah's title from emir to king, and officially changed the 
name of the country to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (see box, p.376 
for an explanation of the term "Hashemite").
CONTEXTS | History

375
Meanwhile, the situation in Palestine had been worsening, with a flood of 
post-Holocaust Jewish immigration and a simultaneous campaign of terror by 
underground Jewish groups aimed at the British. In 1947, Britain announced 
that it would unilaterally pull out of its Palestine mandate. That November, 
the UN approved a plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state, 
with Jerusalem administered internationally. The Jews were unhappy, having 
been denied Jerusalem, and mainstream Arab opinion was outraged at the 
whole idea of conceding any kind of Jewish state in Palestine. On May 15, 
1948, the last British troops departed from Haifa. Jewish forces immediately 
declared an independent State of Israel. Disorganized Arab armies, led by 
Jordan's Arab Legion, simultaneously entered the region intent on taking the 
land allotted to the Jews by the UN. By the time fighting ended in July, Jordan 
had occupied a swathe of the interior of Palestine, as well as the eastern 
districts - and Holy Places - of Jerusalem. The entire Galilee region and the 
valuable fertile coastal strip, including the towns of Haifa, Jaffa, Lydda and 
Ramle, had been lost to Israel. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled, or 
were forcibly ejected, from towns and villages throughout the country, most 
seeking refuge in the Jordanian-held sector, known as the West Bank. In four 
years, the kingdom's population jumped from 435,000 to 1.5 million, of 
whom two-thirds were Palestinian (including more than half a million 
refugees living in temporary camps).
After the hostilities, Abdullah convened a meeting in Jericho of Palestinian 
notables to proclaim the absorption of the Jordanian-occupied West Bank into 
Jordan proper. In April 1950, Jordan formally annexed the West Bank under the 
guise of "uniting the two banks".
Meanwhile the newly formed Arab League ruled that Arab countries should 
not grant citizenship to Palestinian refugees, lest the disowned and displaced 
should then lose their claim to their homeland. To this day, Palestinians who 
sought refuge in Lebanon, Syria and Egypt remain stateless and without rights. 
Jordan was the only Arab country to go against this policy; it formally resettled 
its Palestinian refugees, granting them full Jordanian citizenship and civil rights. 
Abdullah's policy enabled Palestinians in Jordan to rebuild their lives, but it ran 
entirely against mainstream Arab thinking that refused to accept the fact of 
Glubb Pasha
The name of General Sir John Bagot Glubb is generally better known in Jordan than 
T.E. Lawrence: there are still old-timers in Amman who remember him with some 
affection as an upstanding soldier and asset to the young emirate - though many 
other Jordanians associate his name with the colonialist treachery of the British.
Glubb was instrumental in establishing the Arab Legion, as the British-ofﬁcered 
Transjordanian army was known. From 1918, he served ﬁrst in British-controlled Iraq, 
famously halting incursions of bedouin ﬁghters from the desert by establishing a loyal 
bedouin force. In 1930 he was posted to Transjordan, which was suffering from 
similar tribal raids. Glubb set up the bedouin "Desert Patrol", which, after subduing 
the raids, went on to evolve into an elite army unit, serving in World War II and the 
1948 war with Israel. In 1939, Glubb took over supreme command of the Arab Legion 
and became known as "Pasha", an honoriﬁc title awarded to senior Jordanian 
ofﬁcers. However, with the rise of Arab nationalism and the accession to the throne 
of the young King Hussein in 1953, Glubb began to appear increasingly outdated, 
and, worse, a tool of British imperialism. Dismissed in 1956, he went on to write 
dozens of well-respected books on Jordan and Arab history, including his autobiog-
raphy A Soldier with the Arabs. He died in England in 1986.

Israel's existence. Citizenship notwithstanding, most Palestinians - in Jordan and 
elsewhere - felt betrayed by Abdullah's policies from as far back as the 1920s, 
and particularly by his perceived eagerness to absorb Arab Palestine under the 
Hashemite banner. On July 20, 1951, as Abdullah was entering the al-Aqsa 
mosque in Jerusalem for Friday prayers, a young Palestinian stepped up and shot 
him dead. A bullet intended for Abdullah's 15-year-old grandson, Hussein, 
ricocheted off a medal on the boy's chest.
On Abdullah's assassination, the throne passed to Abdullah's 40-year-old son 
Talal, who was in Switzerland receiving medical treatment. Talal returned to 
Amman, but his increasingly erratic behaviour made it clear that he was unfit 
to rule. In 1952, he abdicated in favour of his eldest son, Hussein.
King Hussein's early years: 1952-67
Born in 1935, King Hussein was educated in Britain, at Harrow School and 
Sandhurst military academy. He succeeded to the throne before his seventeenth 
birthday, and was crowned king in May 1953. The Cold War was well estab-
lished, and the new king found himself caught between a powerful Egyptian-
Syrian-Saudi bloc on the one hand, closely allied with the Soviets, and on the 
other, the controlling British presence at the heart of his government pushing 
him towards the pro-Western Baghdad Pact (a British-designed defensive treaty 
against Soviet aggression, subscribed to by Iraq, Turkey, Iran and Pakistan). In 
addition, the 1948 war had utterly changed the character of Jordan, and had 
thrown a cosmopolitan, well-educated and urbanized Palestinian population 
into the midst of an outnumbered Transjordanian population with an entirely 
different, rural and bedouin-based culture. Most of the Palestinians yearned to 
return to their lost homeland, and were unwilling to follow the conciliatory 
and pro-Western Hashemite line; many favoured instead the pan-Arabism 
espoused by the charismatic Egyptian leader, Nasser.
Crisis loomed for Hussein in 1955 and 1956. In nine months, five prime 
ministers came and went. Jordan's declaration of Cold War neutrality angered 
the British, which in turn led to violent street protests in Amman. Hussein 
dismissed the British commander-in-chief of the Jordanian army, Glubb Pasha, 
and replaced him with a Jordanian, but anti-Western feeling continued to run 
high, especially after the British-French-Israeli invasion of Egypt during the 
Suez Crisis of 1956. Jordan's pro-Soviet prime minister Suleiman Nabulsi

The Hashemites
The aristocratic Hashemite dynasty, headed by Jordan's King Abdullah II, traces its 
genealogy back to the Prophet Muhammad - and beyond. An Arab chieftain 
Quraysh, claimed to be a descendant of Ishmael (and thus of Abraham), is said to 
have ﬁrst arrived in Mecca in the second century AD. By 480, his family ruled the city. 
One of his descendants, Hashem, was the great-grandfather of the Prophet 
Muhammad, who was born into the tribe of Quraysh in Mecca in around 571. 
Muhammad's daughter had two sons, and the direct descendants of the elder son 
have been known as "Sharifs" (nobles) since that time. Different Shariﬁan families 
ruled the Hejaz from 967 onwards, with King Abdullah's own branch ruling Mecca 
itself from 1201 right through to 1925, when the Saudis seized control from Sharif 
Hussein.
King Abdullah II, is the 43rd-generation direct descendant of the Prophet 
Muhammad. You can ﬁnd a full account of Hashemite history, including family trees

ended the 1948 Anglo-Jordanian treaty, replacing the British subsidy to Jordan 
with contributions from Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt (the last two soon 
defaulted). British troops left Jordan for good in July 1957. 
To make up the financial shortfall, Hussein requested aid from the US and 
soon afterwards took control of army appointments and suppressed political 
parties and trade unions. The US declared its determination to preserve Jordan's 
independence, and when Syria allied itself with the USSR in September 1957, 
US forces sent a large airlift of arms to Amman.
Throughout the 1950s Egypt and Syria, both then revolutionary republics, kept 
up a bombardment of anti-Hashemite propaganda, with Nasser's Radio Cairo 
particularly vocal in denigrating both the Jordanian government and King Hussein. 
On February 1, 1958, Egypt and Syria announced - to wild celebrations on the 
streets of Jordan as everywhere in the Arab world - their merger in a United Arab 
Republic (UAR); as a counter-move, two weeks later, the Hashemite monarchies 
of Jordan and Iraq announced their own merger in an Arab Federation. The 
latter body survived barely five months, with the entire Iraqi royal family being 
slaughtered in a military coup in July. Meanwhile there was open Muslim insur-
rection in Lebanon, supported by the new UAR against the Christian-led and 
staunchly pro-American Lebanese government. Anti-Western feeling in the 
Middle East was at a peak, and the only obstacles most observers saw standing in 
the way of pan-Arab unity were the Lebanese Christians and Jordan's Hashemite 
monarchy. Few gave the latter much chance of survival.
The American response to the crisis was to bomb Lebanon. Meanwhile, the 
US administration had received a request for help from Jordan, which had run 
out of oil. However, with the revolutionary forces in Syria and Iraq sealing off 
their borders, and the Saudi king in thrall to Nasser's popularity, the only 
remaining direction by which the US could deliver oil to Jordan was over 
Israeli airspace. Amazingly, Hussein applied to Israel for permission, which 
was granted, and the airlift commenced, to a barrage of scorn from all Arab 
sides. Soon after, Britain flew troops into Amman to bolster the regime; they 
too arrived over Israel and the insults rang out again. Nonetheless, in Jordan, 
democracy had been sacrificed for stability, and Hussein's security services 
kept a tight lid on the simmering discontent. Palestinian bombs exploded in 
Amman, and, in 1960, the prime minister was assassinated, but repeated attempts 
on the king's life were foiled.
Opposition to Hussein died down, not least because US aid - and substantial 
remittances from Jordanians working in the Gulf - were fostering tangible 
economic development: Jordan's potash and phosphate industries were 
taking off, modern highways were being built, unemployment was down as 
construction teams expanded East and West Bank cities, and tourism to 
Jordanian Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron and the West Bank, as well as East 
Bank sites, was bringing in much-needed hard currency. Ties with the Saudi 
Arabian monarchy were also strengthening in the face of communism and Arab 
nationalism. Perhaps most important of all, Hussein reluctantly approved the 
creation of a political body to represent the Palestinians, the Palestine Libera-
tion Organization (PLO), founded in 1964. Its charter, in a specific rebuff to 
Jordanian claims on the West Bank, stated that it was to be the "only legitimate 
spokesman" for the Palestinian people.
The Six-Day War and Black September: 1967-74
During 1966, relations with Syria deteriorated and Jordan suspended support 
for the PLO, accusing its secretary of pro-communist activity. Syria and the 
CONTEXTS | History

378
PLO both appealed to the Jordanian people to revolt against King Hussein. 
Clashes followed and PLO-laid bombs exploded in Amman. At the same time, 
skirmishes with Israeli troops led Jordan to introduce conscription. The prospect 
of war with Israel seemed inevitable. In May 1967 Hussein flew to Cairo to 
throw in his lot with Egypt and Syria.
On June 5, Israel launched a pre-emptive strike against its Arab neighbours. 
By the end of the Six-Day War, Jordanian losses were devastating: Israel was 
occupying East Jerusalem and the entire West Bank. Israel had seized the Jawlan 
(Golan Heights) from Syria and the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt. 
In the eyes of the entire Arab world, this was a catastrophe: Egypt and Syria had 
lost relatively small areas of strategic importance, but Jordan had lost fully half 
its inhabited territory, a third of its population, its prime agricultural land and - 
most ignominious - control over the Muslim and Christian holy sites in 
Jerusalem. Up to a quarter of a million refugees crossed to the East Bank, 
putting the government, economy and social services under intolerable 
pressures.
The crushing defeat gave Palestinians in Jordan cause to believe that King 
Hussein and the other Arab leaders were unable or unwilling (or both) to 
liberate their homeland. King Hussein rapidly included equal representation 
from the East and West Banks in the National Assembly, but this was never 
going to satisfy Palestinian demands. The rift grew between the government 
and the Palestinian guerrilla organizations in Jordan - principally Fatah, led 
by Yasser Arafat, chairman of the umbrella PLO. After 1967, these 
groupings - funded by the Gulf states and receiving arms and training from 
Syria - took control in Jordan's refugee camps, backed also by widespread 
grassroots support from Jordan's majority Palestinian population. A fedayeen 
("martyrs") movement developed within the camps, which took on the 
appearance of a state-within-a-state, intent on liberating Palestine by their 
own independent efforts. The fedayeen took for granted their ability to 
overrule King Hussein in his own country, and launched military operations 
against Israel. The ensuing reprisals, however, caused extensive damage to the 
border areas - now Jordan's only remaining agricultural land - and seriously 
undermined any possibilities for a peace settlement with Israel, on which the 
country's long-term future depended.
Black September and its aftermath: 1970-74
Fedayeen opposition to the Hashemite monarchy, rooted in revolutionary 
socialism, remained implacable. Street battles flared in 1968, and in June 1970, 
the Jordanian army mobilized in Amman to assert authority over the guerrilla 
movements. There was an attempt on the king's life. In September, fedayeen 
hijacked three international aircraft to an airfield near Mafraq, ostensibly 
demanding the release of imprisoned comrades, but equally intent on embar-
rassing King Hussein in the eyes of the world and forcing the issue of the Pales-
tinian revolution in Jordan. Once emptied of passengers and crew, all three 
aircraft were spectacularly blown up; the fedayeen then took over Irbid 
proclaiming a "people's government", and the country exploded into violence. 
By the end of "Black September", full civil war was raging, with thousands 
dead and injured. Conflict continued for months but by April 1971, the 
Jordanian army had pushed the fedayeen out of Amman. Three months later, 
after a violent offensive on Palestinian positions around Jerash and Ajloun, 
forces loyal to the king were back in control. The fedayeen fled to Lebanon to 
continue their fight (within four years, civil war had broken out in Lebanon as 
well). Palestinian commandos made three unsuccessful attempts to hijack

Jordanian aircraft, and, in September 1971, members of the Black September 
faction of Fatah assassinated another Jordanian prime minister.
In March 1972 King Hussein made an attempt to regain Palestinian political 
credibility by announcing plans for a federation of Jordan and Palestine, but 
criticism of the plan was almost universal, from Israel, from the exiled Pales-
tinian organizations and from Egypt. A military coup was only just averted. 
Jordan's isolation in the Arab world was almost complete. Nonetheless, Hussein 
attended a reconciliation summit with presidents Sadat of Egypt and Assad 
of Syria, which resulted in a general amnesty for all political prisoners in Jordan, 
including Fatah activists. Jordanian security services and intelligence organiza-
tions were beefed up to deter dissident activity; political parties remained 
banned and the country had no elected parliament. Jordan stayed out of the 
1973 Egyptian-Syrian October War (or Yom Kippur War) against Israel, but 
garnered little kudos for doing so.
The Rabat summit and Camp David: 1974-80
Throughout 1974, King Hussein attempted to preserve his claim over the West 
Bank, flying in the face of the increasing power and prestige of the PLO (Yasser 
Arafat had that year been invited to address the UN General Assembly). In 
October 1974, at the Arab Summit Conference in Rabat, Morocco, twenty 
Arab heads of state passed a resolution recognizing the PLO as the "sole legiti-
mate representative of the Palestinian people". King Hussein reluctantly agreed 
to this, effectively ceding Jordan's claims both to represent the Palestinians and 
to reincorporate the West Bank into the Hashemite realm.
In 1974, Egypt and Syria signed disengagement agreements with Israel; in 
1975 and 1976, King Hussein held secret talks with Israel over the West Bank, 
which later collapsed due to Israel's proposal to retain control over thirty 
percent of the territory. The new realities were thrown into turmoil by Egyptian 
President Sadat's peace initiative in visiting Jerusalem in 1977; Hussein tried to 
stand as an arbiter between Egypt and the rejectionist Arab states (led by Syria), 
while still demanding Israel's complete withdrawal from East Jerusalem, the 
West Bank and Gaza. Jordan joined the rest of the Arab world in scorning the 
US-sponsored Egypt-Israel Camp David accords of 1978, and, as a reward, 
was promised $1.25 billion annually by wealthy Iraq. Throughout the 1970s, 
economic relations with Iraq had been improving, with Iraq funding the 
expansion of Aqaba port and construction of major highways. When Iraq 
invaded Iran in September 1980, launching the bloody Iran-Iraq War, Jordan 
benefited greatly from the passage of goods through Aqaba bound for Iraq.
The Palestinians and the ﬁrst intifada: 1980-89
Since Black September, the PLO's bid for authority over Palestinians on the 
East Bank had - bizarrely - reinforced the stand of both Transjordanian and 
Israeli hardliners. The former had never viewed the Palestinians as true Jorda-
nians anyway. The latter saw the Hashemite monarchy as the sole obstacle to 
annexation of the West Bank by Israel; under the slogan "Jordan is Palestine", 
they pressed for a Palestinian revolution east of the Jordan, offering to help it 
along by expelling Palestinians from the West Bank. Needless to say, this rapidly 
dampened Palestinian opposition to King Hussein in Jordan.
In 1982, the PLO was ejected from its Beirut headquarters by the Israeli
invasion of Lebanon, and sent into further exile in Tunis; humiliated, Arafat 
looked to King Hussein for some way to challenge Israeli hegemony. Hussein 
reconvened Jordan's National Assembly, comprising representatives from both

banks of the Jordan, for the first time since 1967, as a forum for discussion of 
moderate Palestinian opinion away from the extremist intransigence of the 
Syrian position. Israel even permitted West Bank deputies to travel to Amman. 
In March 1984, the first elections in Jordan for seventeen years (and the first 
in which women could vote) took place, although political parties were still 
banned and the eight seats up for grabs were East Bank only.
Less than a year later, in opposition to a widely denounced peace plan put 
forward by US President Reagan (who refused to talk to the PLO), Hussein and 
Arafat agreed to allow Jordan to start direct negotiations with Israel under UN 
auspices, on the basis of Hussein's formula of "land for peace" - that is, the 
return of lands occupied by Israel in 1967 in exchange for a comprehensive 
Arab-Israeli peace. Hardline Syria, though, forced Hussein to drop the initiative, 
partly by assassinating Jordanian diplomats and partly by uniting the Abu Nidal 
Palestinian guerrilla organization with Arafat's main PLO rival, George Habash, 
to attack the accord. At the end of 1985, Hussein and Syria's President Assad 
issued a joint statement rejecting any direct peace negotiations with Israel; 
Hussein's motivation for this was also to put pressure on Arafat to accept UN
Resolution 242, without which the PLO could gain no international credi-
bility. "242" had been a thorn in the side of the Arabs since 1967, since it called 
ambiguously for Israel to withdraw from "occupied territories" (which could 
be taken to mean whatever anyone wanted) and referred to the Palestinians as 
"refugees", thus implying a denial of the existence of a Palestinian nation and 
the right of Palestinians to self-determination, and accepting the right of Israel 
to exist. Hamstrung by extremist attitudes embedded within the PLO, Arafat 
couldn't stop the PLO Executive Committee reiterating its opposition to 242 
in December 1985.
Although rumours of secret talks between Hussein and the Israeli Prime 
Minister Shimon Peres persisted through the mid-1980s, publicly Jordan 
continued to reject Israeli proposals for peace talks which excluded PLO 
participation. In November 1987, King Hussein managed to convene in 
Amman the first full meeting of the Arab League for eight years and, acting in 
the interests of Arab unity, was able to draw Egypt back into the fold after its 
expulsion for making peace with Israel.
The ﬁrst intifada and Jordan's West Bank pull-out: 1987-89
In December 1987, an incident in the Gaza Strip sparked a widespread violent 
Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, 
termed the intifada, or "shaking-off ". Israel was unable to suppress the 
uprising, and, alarmed at the possibility of demonstrations turning violent, the 
Jordanian security services enforced their own clampdown on any shows of 
solidarity. The intensity of the revolt, as well as the Israeli response to it and 
the news that emerged of horrendous living conditions among Palestinians 
under Israeli occupation, alerted world opinion to the necessity of a compre-
hensive settlement in the Middle East. The US Secretary of State, George 
Shultz, came up with a plan, but since it refused participation by the PLO and 
also neglected to address the Palestinian right to self-determination, it was 
rejected by every Arab state.
In a momentous decision on July 31, 1988, with the intifada in full swing, King 
Hussein announced the severing of all legal and administrative links between 
Jordan and the West Bank. By doing so, he effectively ended Hashemite claims 
to Arab Palestine which had been playing beneath the surface of political 
machinations in the region since 1917. The 850,000 Palestinians on the West 
Bank welcomed the clean break. Israel, however, immediately began restricting 
CONTEXTS | History

381
the activities of West Bank Palestinian institutions. Anti-Hashemite opinion 
cynically suggested that Hussein wanted to demonstrate the inability of the 
PLO to run public services and conduct international diplomacy without the 
backing of Jordan.
Shortly afterwards, on November 15, the PLO unilaterally proclaimed an 
independent State of Palestine, endorsing UN Resolution 242 and thus 
implicitly recognizing the right of Israel to exist (within its pre-1967 frontiers). 
Jordan and sixty other countries recognized the new state. The following 
month, Yasser Arafat renounced violence on behalf of the PLO in front of the 
UN General Assembly.
Democracy and the ﬁrst Gulf War: 1989-91
In Jordan, the pull-out from the West Bank caused the value of the dinar to fall 
dramatically, and the austerity measures that followed resulted in price rises of
up to fifty percent on basic goods and services. In April 1989, anti-government 
riots broke out in depressed southern towns such as Karak and Ma'an. The 
prime minister and the entire cabinet resigned, forcing a general election that 
gave a surprising boost to the Islamist and leftist opposition. 1990 was a year of 
desperate crisis for Jordan. The dinar had lost two-thirds of its value in two 
years and unemployment was running at twenty percent. Fraud and embezzle-
ment had been uncovered at the country's second-largest bank, and the scandal 
had spread to the national airline and some 37 other companies. In addition, a 
huge influx of Jews into Israel from the former Soviet Union was resulting in 
ever more settlements going up on the West Bank and a consequent flood of 
Palestinians crossing the river into Jordan. With the West Bank Palestinians 
under almost continuous curfew, the intifada seemed to have fizzled out.
The ﬁrst Gulf War: 1990-91
As the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war juddered to a halt, it became clear that Iraq was in 
no position to repay its loans from the Gulf states. President Saddam Hussein 
campaigned to have the loans cancelled, but Kuwait stood out by refusing to 
accede. This quarrel was complicated by a long-standing border dispute between 
the two countries - and by the fact that the disputed area was rich in oil. King 
Hussein of Jordan pressed for a resolution to the crisis by Arab mediation, but 
before steps could be taken, Iraq suddenly invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990. 
Saddam Hussein quickly proclaimed the annexation of Kuwait to Iraq.
The UN Security Council imposed economic sanctions on Iraq four days 
later, precipitating a further crisis in Jordan. Thousands of Jordanian refugees 
returned destitute from Iraq and Kuwait, ending substantial foreign remittances 
to the kingdom and placing a huge burden on the country's social services. 
Petroleum prices rose sharply, as Jordan's supply of free Iraqi oil (in return for 
loans) dried up; fully a quarter of Jordan's export trade had been to Iraq, and 
this was terminated; and business at Aqaba port was cut overnight, as the road 
to Iraq was closed to trade.
It was clear that Saddam Hussein's actions flouted international law. King 
Hussein attempted to get the Arab League to mediate in the crisis, but he was 
countered by Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria leading calls for international 
action. In August, King Hussein started a round of peacemaking, giving a 
televised address to the US Congress urging withdrawal of the multinational 
force in Saudi Arabia. In November, he warned the World Climate Conference 
of the potentially disastrous environmental effects of war - borne out by Iraq's 
later ignition of Kuwaiti oil installations. The following month, he proposed a 
CONTEXTS | History

382
peace plan linking the Iraq-Kuwait dispute with the Arab-Israeli conflict, and 
advocating dialogue amongst Arab leaders.
His efforts proved fruitless: on January 16, 1991, the Gulf War began, 
sparking widespread anti-Western and anti-Israel demonstrations throughout 
Jordan. Petrol rationing was introduced in Jordan, which only bolstered pro-
Iraqi sentiment. Popular opinion held that the US-led coalition was pursuing 
double standards, condemning Iraqi aggression against Kuwait yet condoning 
Israeli aggression in the occupied territories; that the Gulf States were greedy, 
unwilling to share their new-found oil wealth with other Arabs; and that the 
West, by weighing in against Iraq, was supporting the oil-rich states against the 
poorer Arab states. In the region, King Hussein was highly regarded for being 
the only leader to articulate this opinion fully, although he was lambasted for 
it in the West.
After hostilities ceased in March, the US Congress cancelled an aid programme 
to Jordan in punishment for the king's stance. Kuwait regarded its sizeable 
Jordanian and Palestinian community as collaborators with the Iraqis, and 
expelled them all - about 300,000 people - to Jordan, a further burden on the 
country's social infrastructure.
Peace and crises: 1991-99
In 1991, a new National Charter improved openness within government, 
eased bureaucracy and lifted the ban on political parties, which had been in 
effect since 1963. Martial law, which had been in force since 1967, was repealed. 
Jordan's first one-person one-vote, multi-party elections of November 1993 
saw a 68 percent turnout, with the majority of candidates being independent 
centrists loyally backing the king, although the Islamic Action Front (the 
political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood) gained strong support.
New moves in the Middle East peace process were initiated by the US in 
Madrid in October 1991, Jordan participating in a joint delegation with the 
Palestinians. The peace talks soon hit deadlock, but, unknown even to King 
Hussein, Israel's new left-wing government and the PLO were engaged in 
secret talks in Oslo. In September 1993, they emerged with a Declaration of 
Principles on Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories. Soon after, 
Jordan and the PLO signed agreements on economic and security cooperation, 
closely bonding the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian and Israeli-Jordanian peace talks 
together into a single framework.
On July 25, 1994, in Washington, King Hussein and Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin formally ended the state of war that had existed between their 
two countries since 1948. A full peace treaty followed in October, opposed 
both by Syria and by Islamists within Jordan. A clause in the treaty acknowl-
edging King Hussein as the custodian of the Holy Places in Jerusalem initially 
brought complaints from the PLO that it undermined Palestinian claims to the 
city, later mollified.
In August 1996, under intense pressure from the International Monetary Fund 
to institute austerity measures, the government ended subsidies on grain 
which were producing a ballooning economic deficit. The result was an 
immediate doubling of bread prices, and discontent, especially strong in the 
poorer towns of the south, flared into open rioting. King Hussein suspended 
parliament and sent troops and tanks into Karak and elsewhere to suppress the 
disturbances, but the austerities remained. The election in 1996 of an extreme 
right-wing government in Israel, headed by Binyamin Netanyahu, brought 
the ongoing Middle East peace process to a grinding halt.

For many Jordanians, 1997 was a year of shattered confidence, as the country 
was exposed to a series of domestic and regional crises. Early in the year, a 
Jordanian soldier opened fire on Israeli schoolgirls visiting Baqoura in northern 
Jordan, killing seven. King Hussein attempted to mend ties with Israel by 
personally visiting the bereaved families, a gesture which inspired much 
admiration in Israel and much contempt in the Arab world (no bereaved Arab 
families have ever been consoled by an Israeli leader, the argument ran). Anti-
Israel feeling surged in Jordan. In July, nine major political parties announced 
their intention to boycott the November parliamentary election, as a sign of 
their opposition to normalizing relations with Israel. Diplomatic relations with 
Israel were almost terminated in September, after a botched assassination 
attempt in Amman by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, on an official at 
the Jordanian bureau of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. Days before the 
Jordanian elections in November, Human Rights Watch issued a damning 
report on the state of human rights in Jordan. The elections themselves were 
held to be a whitewash, with extremely low voter turnout and 62 out of 80 
seats won by pro-government or independent centrist candidates. Only 19 out 
of 524 candidates were women, none of whom was elected (the king later 
appointed three women to the Senate). A report from Jordan University 
showed unemployment in the country standing at a crippling 22-27 percent, 
double the official estimate.
The death of King Hussein
Throughout the 1990s, concern had been bubbling under Jordanian politics 
about the health of King Hussein. In August 1992, one of his kidneys was 
removed during an operation for cancer; spring 1996 saw an operation for an 
enlarged prostate, and during 1998 he underwent chemotherapy for lymph 
cancer. All these procedures were done in the US, his youngest brother, Prince 
Hassan, being sworn in as regent on each occasion. In October 1998, Hussein 
witnessed the Wye River Accords, guaranteeing Israeli withdrawal from 
more West Bank land in return for security safeguards from the Palestinians. 
(Two months later Israel suspended the agreement in the face of deepening 
domestic tension, and the Netanyahu government collapsed.) The king's 
appearance at Wye River, to free the negotiations from deadlock despite 
obvious physical frailty, inspired respect but also doubts about his ability to 
continue his public duties.
In January 1999, after six months of treatment in the US, Hussein flew back 
to Jordan. It was clear his health was failing. In a controversially abrupt letter, he 
publicly removed Hassan from the succession after 34 years as Crown Prince, 
and placed in his stead his own eldest son, Abdullah. Within hours, Hussein had 
suffered a relapse. After unsuccessful treatment in the US, he returned again to 
Amman where he died three days later, on February 7, 1999, at the age of 63, 
having been in power for 46 years - one of the longest-serving executive heads 
of state in the world. His funeral drew worldwide media attention, with more 
than fifty heads of state in attendance. Even at a time of tragedy, such a 
turnout, demonstrating the international community's high regard for Jordan 
and its king, was a significant fillip to national confidence.
Jordan under Abdullah II
On the death of Hussein, a swearing-in ceremony confirmed the succession to 
King Abdullah II, who was crowned in July 1999. Abdullah was born in 1962 
to Hussein's second wife, an Englishwoman, formerly Toni Gardiner, who took 
CONTEXTS | History

384
the name Princess Muna al-Hussein when she converted to Islam. Abdullah 
was educated at Oxford and Sandhurst; when he acceded, it was said at first 
that he spoke better English than Arabic. His prominent role in the Jordanian 
military ensured wholehearted support among East Bankers, while the fact that 
his wife, Queen Rania, is a scion of a notable Palestinian family from Tulkarem 
on the West Bank safeguarded his reputation among Jordanians of Palestinian 
origin.
Faced with continuing turmoil in Israel and Palestine, Abdullah has played 
only a minor role in suing for regional peace. In September 2000, the notorious 
right-wing Israeli general Ariel Sharon sparked outrage by touring Jerusalem's 
Haram ash-Sharif, the third-holiest site in Islam. Within weeks Sharon had won 
the Israeli elections, his bullish presence as prime minister effectively halting 
progress in international peace negotiations. The second intifada which 
followed, incomparably bloodier than its forebear of the late 1980s, has 
continued past the death in November 2004 of Yasser Arafat and the January 
2006 stroke which incapacitated Ariel Sharon. Throughout, it has been widely 
supported by the Jordanian people, aided by such vocal bodies as Jordan's Anti-
Normalization Committee, an informal grouping which agitates against any 
contacts - political, social or cultural - with Israel or Israelis.
When a coalition of forces led by the US invaded Iraq in March 2003, 
launching the Second Gulf War, Jordan limited its involvement, refusing to 
open its airspace to coalition aircraft and staying out of the ground war. One 
poll stated that just nine percent of Jordanians supported military action. One 
consequence of the war is that Jordan has absorbed a million or more refugees 
from Iraq. Such vast numbers have put considerable strain on the country's 
health care, housing and education systems. Coordinated suicide bomb 
attacks on three hotels in Amman in November 2005 that killed sixty people 
- for which Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian leader of 'Al-Qaeda in Iraq', 
claimed responsibility - had the unintended effect of turning many ordinary 
Jordanians against Al-Qaeda. US forces killed Zarqawi in an airstrike inside Iraq 
in June 2006, reportedly on a tip-off from Jordanian intelligence.
Economic reform is where Abdullah has made most impact. Jordan became 
the first country (other than Israel) to negotiate a free trade agreement with 
the US, and now has several Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZs), where goods 
are manufactured or processed jointly by Jordan and Israel for distribution to 
the US duty- and quota-free. In 2001, the low-tax Aqaba Special Economic 
Zone (ASEZ) was launched to attract investment to Jordan's Red Sea coast, 
significant foreign investment flowing soon thereafter. Privatization of state 
concerns, such as Jordan Telecom and the airline Royal Jordanian, have 
proceeded apace. Jordan joined the World Trade Organization and has hosted 
several full meetings of the World Economic Forum. A new programme of 
socioeconomic reform was instituted in late 2007. Although the ending of state 
subsidies on petrol and consumer goods a few months later caused prices to 
jump, the beneficial impacts of reform are being felt and - as regards the 
economy, at least - many Jordanians are cautiously optimistic.
Prospects
For many people living in the Middle East, the "9/11" attacks on New York 
and Washington in September 2001 reinforced the urgency of establishing 
peace and prosperity in their region, and the general need for dialogue
between the West and the Muslim world. In Jordan, as in virtually all Arab 
states, there is a discrepancy between the motivations and preoccupations of 
CONTEXTS | History

385
government and those of the general population. The vast majority of Jorda-
nians have no problem with their government's policy of maintaining warm 
relations with the West, as long as this is based on mutual respect and a fair 
crack at social and economic development. However many people instead 
face unemployment and poverty, and feel that their beliefs and concerns are 
being slighted while injustice persists both at home and across the region. 
This alienates them not only from decision-makers in their own country but 
also from the source, as many see it, of their and their neighbours' cultural 
and political oppression - the West and, specifically, the US. Radicalization 
often follows.
The principal challenge for King Abdullah, as for many Arab leaders, is to 
foster the rise of a practical, responsive body politic that is able, in Jordan's case, 
to incorporate strands of liberal democracy, homegrown tribalism and Islam, 
and give each an outlet for expression. Of equal importance is the development 
of a tolerant, participatory civil society to limit polarization and extremism. 
On both fronts, Jordan is generally held to be leaps and bounds ahead of most 
states in the region, but it is held back by the lack of progress on the key issue 
that casts a shadow over the whole region: a just and comprehensive resolution 
of the Israeli-Palestinian problem. It is increasingly obvious that while conflict 
persists in Israel and/or Palestine, there can only ever be limited and ultimately 
unsatisfying social, economic or political development in Jordan.
It can fairly be said that both King Abdullah I and King Hussein recognized 
this fact and devoted their careers, and their lives, to addressing it. By 
promoting economic reform - and thereby raising the standard of living for 
ordinary Jordanians - King Abdullah II has demonstrated his key role in 
promoting regional stability and creating a framework for sustainable devel-
opment at home.
CONTEXTS | History

Flora and fauna
Jordan has a great variety of wildlife, not least because it lies at the crossroads of 
the Mediterranean, Arabia and Africa. The deserts contain a rich flora and fauna 
especially adapted to the harsh environment, and there's even life in the Dead 
Sea - you just need a microscope to see the species of bacteria which are 
known to occur.
Mosaics, rock art and frescoes paint a picture of Jordan's wildlife at a time when 
its significance was as a source of food (and, later, sport). Ancient rock art in the 
eastern deserts depicts gazelles, ibex and ostriches, and stone corrals remain as 
evidence of systematic trapping by previous generations of bedouin. Eighth-
century frescoes at Qusayr Amra suggest that hunting game, such as the onager 
(a wild ass from Persia), was a great attraction for visitors from Damascus. These 
images also afford a glimpse of some larger animals which have subsequently 
become extinct due to excessive hunting and habitat destruction. It's hard to 
imagine today that leopards, Asiatic lions, cheetah, Syrian bears and crocodiles 
once roamed Jordan's deserts, forests and rivers. It's also hard to appreciate how 
quickly the thousands of gazelles present until the mid-1940s were reduced to 
near-extinction following the arrival of automatic weapons and motor vehicles; 
ostrich, Houbara bustard, oryx and onagers all went the same way.
For many years, Jordan's Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature 
(RSCN) has pursued a plan to re-establish populations of some of the 
country's extinct mammals in the wild. Projects involving oryx, Nubian ibex 
and roe deer have all been marked by success, even though most of these 
animals' former ranges have been overgrazed by goats and sheep.
Major habitats
Jordan's varied topography, climate and geology interact to produce a patchwork 
of often tightly packed habitats: you can travel from pine forest to desert in an 
hour's drive. Broadly speaking, the country can be divided into four major 
regions: the rift valley, rift margins, highlands and interior deserts. Each of these 
contains a range of habitats which vary north to south, west to east and from 
low to high altitudes. In addition, there are habitats specific to the desert oases, 
rivers and coast.
The rift valley comprises - from north to south - the Jordan Valley, the Dead 
Sea, Southern Ghor, Wadi Araba and the Gulf of Aqaba (before continuing on 
to the Red Sea and the East African Rift Valley). The whole valley is warm to 
hot, the only appreciable rain falling in the north, which is exposed to rainfall 
from Mediterranean weather systems and thus lushly vegetated.
The highlands constitute a spine of hills running north-south down the 
length of the country, dissected by major wadi systems flowing westwards. 
Terrain in the north, up to 1250m above sea level, comprises the country's 
richest agricultural land. Further south and east, a reduction in altitude and 
rainfall produces an undulating, steppe terrain (now mostly arable). The Shara 
mountains in the south, behind Petra, reach 1700m; their steppe habitat is 
unique in Jordan. Towards Aqaba, dissected granite mountains add further 
variation to this upland range.
Between the highlands and the rift valley, a deeply incised, west-facing escarp-
ment contains some of the most dramatic of Jordan's scenery, including Petra 
and Dana. As you descend, habitats within this rift margin change with the 
drop in rainfall.
CONTEXTS | Flora and fauna

387
The interior deserts, covering eighty percent of Jordan's area, are typically 
flat, with geological variations controlling a complex pattern of fascinating 
habitats. Flint and limestone deserts predominate, with sand deserts rarer. Of 
considerable interest is the basalt desert, a vast expanse of boulders harbouring 
a unique fauna adapted to live in this harsh habitat. The Rum desert is far 
from flat, with Jordan's highest mountains (reaching above 1800m) among its 
towering peaks; the valleys between contain the country's finest sand dunes, 
largely stabilized with broom and other scrub. Much of the eastern desert's 
sporadic rainfall drains into mud flats or qas which, for brief, irregular 
periods, support huge quantities of life from invertebrates to the birds that 
feed on them.
Water is a valuable resource, and rivers are in short supply. Much of the flow 
of the Jordan River is now diverted for agriculture: a mere trickle remains. 
Many of its tributaries are now dammed, and as a result, the future for riverine 
wildlife in Jordan looks uncertain. Azraq was a textbook oasis until water 
extraction put an end to the natural flow of its springs. Other oases are small, 
such as those along the base of the rift margins and at Aqaba. Jordan's few 
kilometres of arid, sparsely vegetated coastline are fringed by coral reef, before 
the seabed plunges to depths of over 500m.
Mammals
A little detective work is needed to spot Jordan's mammalian wildlife, as many 
of the larger animals survive only in the remotest corners and the smaller 
animals are typically nocturnal. Discarded quills offer the only clue that 
nocturnal porcupines have been through; the Palestinian mole rat gives 
itself away by leaving telltale molehills. The pine forests around Dibbeen are 
home to Persian squirrels, closely related to Europe's red squirrel; even if you 
don't see one, you can look for the chewed pine cones they leave behind.
Excepting a chance sighting of Nubian ibex at Dana or Mujib, or a Dorcas 
gazelle in Wadi Araba, the largest wild mammal you are likely to see in Jordan 
is a red fox, not to be confused with the ubiquitous feral dogs. Jordan's few 
wolves, jackals and striped hyenas keep well away from humans. Felines are 
represented by the wildcat and the caracal, both quite rare. Next largest is 
probably the Cape hare, which has evolved to become more rabbit-sized in 
the warm Arabian climate. But by far the most abundant are the varieties of 
mice, gerbils, jerboas and jirds - hamster-like rodents that make their home 
in desert burrows. A few rock hyrax - a burrowing rodent that's a close relative 
of the elephant, though just the size of a cat - remain in Dana and Rum. You 
may glimpse a mongoose scurrying along the banks of the River Zarqa.
The one-humped dromedary, the camel found in Arabia, has a history 
inextricably associated with that of the bedouin, and it has been a beast of 
burden as well as a source of milk and meat for many thousands of years. All 
Jordan's camels are domesticated, any vestiges of wild stock having vanished 
long ago.
Birds
Jordan has a lot to offer the birdwatcher: there are many resident bird species, 
some native to the Middle East, while others have European and even African 
affinities. Some species migrate vast distances to breed in Jordan, others winter 
here from points further north. Add to these the through-migration of literally 
millions of birds in spring and autumn - either dropping in for a rest or just 
CONTEXTS | Flora and fauna

388
flying over - and it is not difficult to imagine how well over four hundred 
species have been identified in a relatively small country, with additional species 
being added each year.
Although some locals do hunt under licence from the RSCN, it is a relief that 
Jordanian culture differs from that of much of the Mediterranean, where birds 
are slaughtered in their millions using nets, bird-lime and guns. Traditional Arab 
hunting with falcons (or even bringing falcons into the country) is also illegal, 
and it is regrettable that visiting hunters and falconers continue to have an 
impact by trapping migratory birds of prey in the eastern deserts.
Native bird species
Jordan has eight endemic Near East species - sooty falcon, sand partridge, 
Tristram's grackle, Hume's tawny owl, Arabian babbler, hooded 
wheatear, Arabian warbler and Syrian serin; their breeding ranges include 
Jordan's southern rift valley, rift margins and Rum desert. Of these, the starling-
like grackle, with its orange wing flash and evocative whistling call, is the most 
likely to be seen.
Jordan's deserts are home to many characteristic birds. These include the 
many larks and wheatears, each of which is superbly adapted to its chosen 
habitat, such as Temminck's horned lark in the flat, eastern deserts, hoopoe
lark in sandier areas and white-crowned black wheatear in the rockiest 
mountains. Although Jordan's national bird, the Sinai rosefinch, is only the size 
of a small sparrow, the male's vivid pink plumage evokes Jordan's rose-red city 
of Petra and the red cliffs and desert sands of Wadi Rum. Sunbirds are the Old 
World equivalent of the hummingbird, and in Jordan the male Palestine 
sunbirds flash iridescent purple and blue as they hover - for example, by the 
borage flowers in the Dana campsite. The basalt desert is also home to a unique 
population of mourning wheatears, whose virtually all-black colouring 
better matches its surroundings.
Migrant and breeding bird species
Jordan's position at the crossroads between Europe, Asia and Africa results in a 
cosmopolitan bird community. Species such as black-eared wheatear, 
woodchat shrike, hoopoe and black-headed bunting have affinities with 
southeastern Europe. Jordan is on the southern extreme of several species' 
ranges, such as blue and great tits. The Cyprus warbler and Cyprus 
wheatear also have restricted breeding ranges, and occur in Jordan on 
migration. The African influence is less obvious, though many migrant species 
retreat to Africa in winter. Isolated pairs of the Verreaux's eagle, more at 
home feeding on hyraxes in east and southern Africa, are also found in Jordan.
The country also hosts several species that are globally or regionally threat-
ened, including griffon vulture and lesser kestrel (which breed in Jordan) 
and imperial eagle, Levant sparrowhawk and corncrake (which are found 
in Jordan on migration or in winter).
Spring migration sees millions of birds returning from wintering in Africa to 
their breeding grounds in eastern Europe and western Russia, via the rift valley. 
Migrant warblers, pipits and wagtails, for instance, use every available scrap 
of cover in which to shelter and refuel, whether on a traffic island in Aqaba, a 
sewage works, a clump of bushes in the open desert or in the meagre shade 
underneath a parked car. From late February through to May, vast numbers of 
raptors, including eagles, buzzards, kites, hawks and falcons, use traditional 
routes over Jordan's rift margins, typically seeking out a remote hillside to roost 
overnight before continuing. The head of the Gulf of Aqaba is a migration 
CONTEXTS | Flora and fauna

389
bottleneck, and north from here they peel off to get to their specific destina-
tions. In contrast, the migration front is much broader in autumn, when birds 
are not averse to stopping off to eat or drink.
In wet winters, the inflow of the River Jordan into the Dead Sea gives rise to 
a layer of fresh water which persists for some time above the salt water before 
mixing; in these circumstances, it's possible to witness the rather incongruous 
sight of ducks swimming on the Dead Sea. Herons often gather at places like 
the Mujib delta to feed on the fish that die when they reach the saline water.
Insects
Insects are particularly obvious in the hotter seasons. Butterflies are colourful 
and easy to spot, though, as with birds, where you are will dictate whether you 
see European or Arabian species. Representatives of the swallowtails, blues, 
coppers, whites, marbled whites, fritillaries, painted ladies and tortoiseshells all 
occur, some migrating in spectacular fashion in their hundreds of millions. 
One of the rarest and most beautiful of the migrant butterflies is the large 
orange, black and white plain tiger, which is commoner in some springtimes 
than others.
It is easy to see all shapes and sizes of beetles in Jordan - around 1700 species 
have been identified in the country. The long-legged, black pitted beetle is 
one of the most obvious, as are scarab beetles and dung beetles. Large black 
millipedes are a feature of Jordan's ruins, such as Jerash.
Jordan has three species of scorpion (pale-yellow and black in colour), all of 
which can inflict sufficiently painful stings to warrant a visit to hospital. Unless 
you are particularly lucky (or unlucky), you're unlikely even to see one, unless 
you make a habit of turning over stones. Solifugids, or camel spiders, are 
formidable hunters, but are not venomous despite having a strong bite.
Grasshoppers, moths, dragonflies, solitary wasps, cicadas, locusts and praying 
and ground mantises are other obvious insects, with the list practically 
endless. Bluebottle-like flies are a pest, especially in the hot Jordan Valley 
summer. Mosquitoes tend to be more of an irritation than a pest or health 
hazard.
Reptiles, amphibians and freshwater ﬁsh
No desert would be complete without lizards. Around fifty species have 
been identified in Jordan, the largest of which is the desert monitor, 
reaching 130cm in length. There are nocturnal geckos with their sticky toe-
pads, hammer-headed agamas, smooth-skinned skinks and long-tongued 
chameleons. In Wadi Araba, you may glimpse the 65cm spiny-tailed (or
Dhab) lizard - with its chunky, scaly tail - before it flees down its burrow. 
At Petra the dazzlingly turquoise male Sinai agama is one of the most 
eye-catching.
Snakes are much talked about and feared, but rarely seen. There are 24 species, 
including five that are venomous, particularly the Palestine viper and the 
horned viper.
Where there is water, marsh frogs occur in an extraordinary variety of 
colours and patterns, though it's easier to hear their croaking than it is to find 
them. There are a small number of freshwater fish in the River Jordan and its 
tributaries. On the mud flats of Azraq, millions of dormant eggs hatch when the 
area floods, giving rise to vast populations of the small killifish, which provide 
a valuable food source to migrating birds.
CONTEXTS | Flora and fauna

390
Red Sea life
The clear, warm waters of the Gulf of Aqaba host a fringing coral reef, the 
most northerly in the world, which is particularly rich in coral and fish species. 
The shallow reef flat lies closest to the shore, but this soon gives way at the reef 
crest to the steeply shelving reef slope. Elsewhere, in sandy bays and at the head 
of the gulf, sea-grass beds host colonies of garden-eels. Looking like blades of 
tall grass at first glance, these long sinuous creatures soon disappear into their 
burrows when approached.
Some one thousand species of fish occur off Aqaba, including the slimline
angel- and butterfly fishes, coral-eating parrot fishes, predatory groupers, 
parasite-picking cleaner wrasse, shoals of red jewelfish, luminescent "flash-
light fish", and the oddly shaped box fishes. Of the venomous fish, the 
lionfish is one of the most beautiful in the reef with its feather-like fins, 
whereas the stonefish is as ugly as they come, dull, bulky and covered in wart-
like protrusions. Seeing a turtle, shark or porpoise off Aqaba requires a calm 
sea and a lot of luck; diving affords a better chance than watching from the 
shore or in a glass-bottomed boat.
Flora
For a country that is eighty percent semi-desert, Jordan's plant list is 
outstanding. Visit the higher ground in March or April, especially after a wet 
winter, and you will witness swathe after swathe of green, red and blue 
blanketing the hillsides.
On the downside, the desert landscape has changed dramatically following 
human introduction of sheep and goats, which has accelerated wind and rain 
erosion and desertification, putting tremendous pressure on the native wildlife. 
Overgrazing of the fragile semi-desert flora is ubiquitous, with the effects 
visible at Shaumari; compare the thick bushes inside the enclosures with the 
pitiful remnants outside. Many of Jordan's trees are grazed - the evergreen oaks, 
for example - and have responded by growing small, tough leaves at grazing 
height. Other trees are much hacked for firewood. Unusually heavy snow in the 
highlands can even snap mature trees under its weight.
Shrubs and herbaceous plants
Cyclamen are one of the earliest blooms, making their first appearance in late 
winter, followed by poppies, anemones and crocuses in March. Most of Jordan's 
22 species of orchid flower in April in the highland forests of the northwest. 
April is also the optimum time to see the black iris, Jordan's national flower. 
One of at least four irises that are endemic to this region, it isn't actually jet-
black, rather a very dark purple. The upland hillsides are often carpeted with 
low spiky bushes and aromatic herbs such as thyme and sage-brush (Artemesia). 
In summer, thistles, which grow in profusion and in great varieties, take on a 
new beauty as the six rainless months of fierce heat turn almost everything into 
a desiccated, buff-brown relic. However, some flowers do bloom at this time, for 
example the sea-onion, which carpets the flatter ground inside Petra and 
flowers in July; in autumn, crocuses add the only touch of colour when every-
thing else is parched.
In early spring, if the ground warms up after winter rains, the deserts can 
become flushed with grasses and flowers, though this isn't on a dramatic scale 
and is often short-lived: if the sheep and goats don't eat the new arrivals, they 
soon succumb to the heat. White broom bushes line the wadis; a parasitic 
CONTEXTS | Flora and fauna

391
broomrape, the cistanche, is a spike of yellow in the semi-desert. Desert 
melons, found in the eastern desert, are poisonous and avoided by animals, and 
wild capers grow in the Jordan Valley.
Trees
Trees are largely restricted to the highlands, especially the Mediterranean 
regions of the northwest. Several species of evergreen and deciduous oaks, 
Aleppo pines, carob and strawberry trees can still be found in Jordan, along 
with fast-growing, introduced eucalyptus, cypress and casuarinas. Almond
trees bloom early and figs grow wild near water sources in the hills. Ancient, 
gnarled junipers are characteristic of the Petra and Dana mountains. Natural 
forest remains only in parts of the northern highlands (mainly pines) and in 
the inaccessible mountain landscape around Dana and Petra (oak and juniper). 
Forests were undoubtedly more extensive in the past, and the operation of the 
Hejaz Railway is often cited as a major destroyer of woodlands, which were cut 
down to fuel the trains.
On lower ground, acacias give Wadi Araba a distinctly African look, while 
palms are found by freshwater springs such as Aqaba and Azraq. Wadi Butm, at 
Qusayr Amra, gets its name from the Arabic word for the ancient Atlantic
pistachio trees that line the wadi. Although not nut-producing, they provide 
vital shelter for much resident and migrant wildlife. Similarly rare is the 
funeral cypress, of which a small number of reportedly native trees remain 
near Dana.

Islam
It's almost impossible to make any sense out of the Middle East - or Jordan - 
without knowing something of Islam. Well over ninety percent of Jordan's 
population are Muslim, and the practice and philosophy of Islam permeate 
most aspects of daily life. What follows is the briefest of backgrounds.
Islam was the third of the great monotheistic religions to originate in the 
Middle East, and places itself firmly in the tradition begun by Judaism and 
Christianity. Abraham is seen as the first Muslim, and Islam itself is defined as a 
reaffirmation, correction and consummation of the earlier faiths.
Islam was propagated in the seventh century AD by a merchant named 
Muhammad from the city of Mecca, in the Hejaz region of what is now Saudi 
Arabia. Muhammad is seen as the last of a series of prophets sent by God to 
earth; among earlier prophets were Abraham, Noah, Moses, Solomon, Job, John 
the Baptist and Jesus, whose messages, for whatever reason, had been lost or 
corrupted over the centuries. Muhammad was sent to revive and refine the 
words of past prophets.
The basic principles of Islam are that there is one God (in Arabic, Allah), and 
he must be worshipped; and that Muhammad is his final prophet. The main 
sources of the religion are the Quran (or Koran) - the revelation Muhammad 
received during his lifetime - and Muhammad's own actions.
The Quran
Muslims regard the Quran (literally, "recitation") to be the word of God, as 
revealed by the angel Jibril (Gabriel) to Muhammad from about 610 AD, when 
Muhammad was about 40, until his death in 632. There is a noticeable differ-
ence in the style of the Quran between the early portions - which have the 
ring of soothsaying about them, arising from Muhammad's early role as mystic 
- and the later portions, which go into detail about the conduct of Muslim life, 
as befits Muhammad's status as the leader of a large group of followers.
The principal emphasis of the Quran is on the indivisibility of God. Human 
duty is to demonstrate gratitude to God by obedience and worship - islam itself
means "submission" - for he will judge the world on the Day of Resurrection. 
Islamic concepts of heaven, as reward, and hell, as punishment, are close to 
CONTEXTS | Islam
The Amman Message
In 2004, King Abdullah published the Amman Message, a communiqué drawn up 
with Muslim authorities from around the world to declare - as its summary states - 
"what Islam is and what it is not, and what actions represent it and what actions do 
not. Its goal [is] to clarify to the modern world the true nature of Islam and the nature 
of true Islam." The message speciﬁcally rejects extremism as being a deviation from 
Islamic belief and the accompanying press release talks of Abdullah's "determination 
to ward off Muslim image-tarnishing, marginalization and isolation". 
A subsequent convention of two hundred Muslim scholars from over ﬁfty countries 
issued a three-point declaration conﬁrming the Amman Message. This recognized 
diversity of opinion within Islam, prohibited the practice (common among extremists) 
of declaring other Muslims as apostates and clariﬁed who (and who may not) issue 
religious edicts, or fatwas. For the full text, and background information, go to

Christian ideas, although the way they are described in the Quran is very 
physical, even earthy. God sent the prophets to humankind in order to provide 
the guidance necessary to attain eternal reward.
The Quran is divided into 114 chapters, or suras. The first sura is a prayer 
which Muslims recite frequently: "Praise be to God, Lord of the Worlds, the 
Compassionate, the Merciful, King of the Day of Judgement. We worship you 
and seek your aid. Guide us on the straight path, the path of those on whom 
you have bestowed your Grace, not the path of those who incur your anger nor 
of those who go astray." After this, the suras are in approximate order of length, 
starting with the longest and ending with the shortest; many are patched 
together from passages revealed to Muhammad at different periods of his life.
According to traditional Islamic belief, the Quran is the word of God which 
has existed forever. It is unique, and is the miracle which Muhammad presented 
to the world to prove his prophethood. However, not everything the Quran 
reveals is comprehensible; the book itself declares that it contains "clear" verses 
and "obscure" verses. On occasions, it appears to contradict itself. As a result, an 
elaborate literature of interpretation of the Quran developed. Early specialists 
put forward the idea that some revelations were made for a particular place or 
time and were cancelled out by later revelations.
The Hadith
The Quran provided a basic framework for the practices and beliefs necessary 
for Muslims, but it didn't go into much specific detail: of 6616 verses, only 
eighty concern issues of conduct. For precise guidance, Muslims also look to 
the example and habitual practice sunna of the Prophet Muhammad himself, as 
well as his words and actions. These were remembered by those who had 
known him, and transmitted in the form of reports, hadith, handed down 
within the Muslim community - hadith is generally translated into English as 
"traditions".
Although Muhammad himself didn't claim any infallibility outside revealing 
the Quran, Muslims around him seem to have collected these hadith from a very 
early time. Scholars soon began categorizing them by subject. It was obvious, 
though, that many of the reports of what the Prophet said or did weren't 
authentic; tales wove their way into his legend, and some of those who trans-
mitted reports of his doings undoubtedly invented or exaggerated them. 
Scholars therefore developed a science of hadith criticism, requiring both 
specific content of what the Prophet is supposed to have said or done, and, more 
importantly, a traceable chain of transmission back to the Companion of the 
Prophet who had originally seen or heard it. Biographical dictionaries - to 
ascertain just how reliable a transmitter was - rapidly became a distinctive 
feature of Arabic literature. Two particularly refined collections of hadith from 
the late ninth century are generally held to have an authority second only to 
that of the Quran.
The pillars of Islam
Drawn both from the Quran and the hadith, there are five basic religious duties 
every Muslim must perform.
Statement of faith
Firstly, and most simply, is the statement of faith (shahada): "I testify that there 
is no god but God, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God." If you say 
this with sincerity, you become a Muslim.
CONTEXTS | Islam

394
Prayer
A Muslim must perform formal prayer (salat) five times a day. Since the day 
begins at sunset, the five times are sunset (maghrib), evening (isha), dawn (fajr), 
midday (duhr) and afternoon (asr), the exact times set in advance by the religious 
authorities. Before performing the salat, a Muslim must be in a state of ritual 
purity, achieved by rinsing out the mouth, sniffing water into the nostrils, 
washing the face, head, ears, back of the neck, feet, and lastly the hands and 
forearms. All mosques, big or small, have ablutions fountains adjacent for 
worshippers to cleanse themselves.
The faithful are summoned to prayer by the muezzin; in previous centuries, 
he would climb the minaret of the mosque and call by shouting, but almost 
everywhere in Jordan this has now been overtaken either by a taped call to prayer 
or by amplification. Nonetheless, the sound of the adhan (call to prayer) has a 
captivating beauty all its own, especially down in the echoing valleys of Amman 
when dozens of mosques are calling simultaneously, repeating in long, melodious 
strings: "God is most great! (Allahu akbar!) I testify that there is no god but God. 
(Ashhadu an la ilaha illallah.) I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of God. 
(Ashhadu anna Muhammadan rasulullah.) Come to prayer! (Hayya alas-salah!)
Come to salvation! (Hayya alal-falah!) God is most great! (Allahu akbar!)" The 
dawn call has another phrase added: "Prayer is better than sleep."
Once worshippers have assembled in the mosque, another call to prayer is 
given. Prayers are led by an imam, and are performed in a ritualized cycle 
facing towards Mecca without shoes on: standing with hands slightly raised, 
bowing, prostrating, sitting on one's haunches, and prostrating again. During the 
cycle, worshippers recite verses of the Quran, particularly the opening sura. 
Repetition of the cycles is completed by everyone turning and wishing peace 
on each other.
One way in which Islam differs from Christianity and Judaism is that it has 
no priests. The imam who leads the prayers has no special qualification to do 
so, other than enough knowledge of the Quran to enable him to recite, or 
perhaps some standing in the local community. Anyone may lead prayers, and 
there is no claim to special religious knowledge or holiness marking out an 
imam from any other Muslim.
The midday prayer on Fridays is a special congregational prayer, and Muslims 
are expected to attend a large mosque of assembly, where a religious or political 
sermon is also given (and generally broadcast on loudspeakers). The sermon

The Islamic Calendar
The Islamic calendar is dated from sunset on July 15, 622 AD, the start of the hijra
(migration) of the Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to the nearby city of Medina; the 
Western (Gregorian) year 2010 AD mostly coincides with the Islamic year 1431 (AH 
1431). Whereas the Western calendar is solar, the Islamic one (like the Jewish) is lunar, 
and thus one Muslim year contains slightly over 354 days. The effect of this is that 
Muslim religious festivals move in a slow cycle backwards through the seasons, each 
one arriving about eleven days earlier, according to the Western calendar, than it did 
the previous year. To convert from an Islamic year number to a Western one, divide it 
by 1.031, then add 621 or 622 (depending on which month you're in). An easier option 
is to consult an online calendar, such as the one at Wwww.islamicﬁnder.org.
The names of the Islamic months are: Muharram, Safar, Rabia Awwal, Rabia 
Thaani, Jumada Awwal, Jumada Thaani, Rajab, Shaaban, Ramadan, Shawwal, Dhul 
Qida and Dhul Hijja. All have either 29 or 30 days, with the new month declared only 
when the crescent moon has been sighted.

395
must include a mention of the legitimate ruler - in fact, this is one of the tradi-
tional ways for a population to bestow legitimacy on a ruler. If the mosque is 
controlled by the government, the sermon is often used to endorse government 
policy; if it is independent, the Friday sermon can be used as a means to incite 
rebellion among the faithful. This is part of the reason why many political 
demonstrations in the Muslim world begin from the mosque after the midday 
prayer on a Friday.
Although it's preferable for men to pray together in the mosque, it's not 
obligatory, and you'll see many men throughout Jordan instead laying down 
a small prayer mat in their shops, or by the side of the road, to mark out a 
space for them to pray alone. Women almost always pray at home. Non-
Muslims are permitted to enter mosques in Jordan, but only at the discretion 
of the officials of that particular mosque; however, you must always be dressed 
suitably modestly. If you're not praying, you don't have to go through any 
ritual ablutions.
A very common sight in Jordan is to see men holding strings of "worry 
beads", passing them rhythmically through their fingers in an almost uncon-
scious action as they walk or sit quietly. The beads - tasbih or subhah - are 
prayer beads, and they always come in strings of 33 or 99, representing the 99 
revealed names of God. As one passes through the fingers, the prayer is 
subhanallah ("Glory to God"); the next one is al-hamdulillah ("Thanks be to 
God"), the next Allahu akbar ("God is most great"), these three being repeated 
in a mantra until the cycle of 99 has been completed.
Alms
All Muslims who are able to do so should pay one-fortieth of their own wealth 
for purposes laid down in the Quran: for the poor, for those whose hearts need 
to be reconciled, for the freeing of slaves, those who are burdened with debts, 
for travellers, for the cause of God, and so on. This payment of alms is called 
zakat, literally "purification", and is primarily regarded as an act of worship: the 
recipients are less important than the giving, which is always done 
anonymously.
Fasting in the month of Ramadan
Ramadan is the ninth month of the Muslim year, and was the time at which 
Muhammad received his first revelation; it's a holy month, during which all 
Muslims must fast from dawn to sunset each day. All forms of consumption are 
forbidden during daylight hours, including eating, drinking and smoking, and 
any form of sexual contact. However, this is only the outward show of what is 
required: one hadith says, "There are many who fast all day and pray all night, 
but they gain nothing but hunger and sleeplessness." Ramadan is a time of 
spiritual cleansing.
As the Muslim calendar is lunar, Ramadan doesn't fall in a specific season each 
year: summer Ramadans in the Middle East, when the days are fourteen or 
fifteen hours long and the heat draining, can be particularly taxing, but 
Ramadan is an intense month at any time of year. Families get up together 
before dawn for a quick breakfast (many people then go back to bed for another 
few hours' sleep). During the day, shops, offices and public services all operate 
limited hours. As the afternoon draws on, people hurry home to be with their 
families for iftar, the fast-breaking meal, eaten at sunset. After dark, a hectic 
round of socializing over large meals often brings distant relatives together for 
the only time in the year. Ramadan is quieter in Jordan than, say, Egypt (where 
Ramadan nights involve huge, festive street parties), but nonetheless a special 
CONTEXTS | Islam

396
mood of excitement grips people all over the country. The month ends with a 
three-day festival, Eid al-Fitr, also a time for family get-togethers.
Pilgrimage
Mecca was a sacred place long before the time of Muhammad, its central 
feature the Kaaba, a fifteen-metre-high stone cube inset with a smaller, holy 
black stone. Islam incorporated both the Kaaba and a set of rituals involved 
with pagan worship at Mecca into its own set of rituals around the hajj, or 
pilgrimage, which takes place in the twelfth month, Dhul Hijja. (A lesser 
pilgrimage, known as the umrah, can be undertaken at any time of year.) Every 
Muslim who has the means must make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once 
in his lifetime. These days, over two million descend each year on Mecca for 
the hajj from all over the world, the whole operation coordinated by the Saudi 
Ministry of Hajj.
The Kaaba, now in the central precinct of the vast Grand Mosque at Mecca, 
is held to have been built by Abraham and his son Ishmael on the ruins of a 
shrine built by Adam, the first human. Male pilgrims wear only two lengths of 
plain, unsewn cotton cloth (symbolizing the equality of all before God); women 
veil their hair but must leave their faces uncovered, to express confidence and 
an atmosphere of purity. Everybody circumambulates the Kaaba seven times, 
emulating the angels who circle the throne of God, and kisses the black stone 
if they can. They go to the Well of Zamzam, discovered by Ishmael, and run 
between two small hills, commemorating the frantic running in search of water 
by Hagar - Abraham's concubine and Ishmael's mother - after Abraham had left 
them both in the desert. One day is spent on the arid Plain of Arafat, listening 
to sermons, praying and standing on the Mount of Mercy. All the pilgrims go 
to Mina, a suburb of Mecca, and hurl stones at three pillars, symbolically stoning 
the Devil. The hajj ends with the four-day festival of Eid al-Adha, celebrated 
throughout the Islamic world, when all who are able slaughter a sheep to 
commemorate Abraham's sacrifice - he was about to kill his son but God 
stopped him and provided a ram instead (Jews and Christians hold that the 
victim was to have been Isaac, but Muslims believe it was Ishmael).
There are often parties and celebrations to welcome home those who have 
returned from the hajj, and in Jordan you'll sometimes see murals painted by 
pilgrims on the outside walls of their houses, depicting the mosque at Mecca 
(with the Islamic symbol of the crescent often prominent), the Kaaba and other 
details of what they saw and experienced on their journey.

The bedouin today
This article, by Dr Géraldine Chatelard, Research Fellow at the French Institute 
for the Near East (IFPO) in Jordan, is an edited version of her introduction to 
Bédouins Aujourd'hui en Jordanie, an outstanding book of photos by Nabil 
Boutros that was published by Amman's French Cultural Centre (Wwww
.lecentre-jo.org) in 2008. The English translation is by Isabelle Ruben.
F
or centuries the bedouin have been in transition between a nomadic 
life in the arid margins and a settled, urban life. Transition and mobility 
are difficult notions for sedentary people to grasp, for they defy catego-
rization. The sedentary outlook through which the world is normally 
perceived is so dominant that the bedouin themselves sometimes have doubts 
about what makes them distinctive: is it their nomadic lifestyle, their skill as 
herders in an arid environment, their tribal organization, or their values and 
morality? These questions are a reflection of the diversity of bedouin society, 
which is neither isolated nor separated but, rather, is dynamic and eager to 
harness the benefits of the modern world while preserving its values of 
solidarity, pride and honour.
Many of today's bedouin have transformed their spatial mobility into social
mobility, a process which, in Jordan, began in the 1930s. First was recruitment 
into the armed forces and the government, then came widespread schooling. 
Bedouin families developed agriculture, mostly abandoning camel husbandry in 
favour of sheep and goats. They took advantage of modern technology - motor 
vehicles (particularly the water tankers that made them less dependent on 
natural constraints) and now mobile phones. The nomads who formerly moved 
seasonally across several hundred kilometres became transhumant herders living 
in tents for only part of the year, or sometimes not leaving their villages at all 
and entrusting their herds to shepherds. At the same time, a new generation has 
been settling in the towns, completing higher education and taking up profes-
sional careers while still maintaining strong links with their original villages and 
tribes - a process which has ensured the preservation of bedouin values and 
identity in an urban setting.
Use of space
The bedouin tent (known as beit ash-sha'ar, meaning "house of hair") is a 
mobile shelter with internal spaces that can be rearranged using movable parti-
tions: transitions from exterior to interior, sunlight to shade, heat to cool are 
adjustable according to need. There is always a clear division between the public 
and private sides of the tent, usually in the form of a partition - decorated on 
the public side, backed by furniture (a chest, mattresses, bed coverings) on the 
private side.
Domestic tents are erected and maintained by the women of the family, or 
under their supervision. They make the tent from goat hair and sheep's wool, 
weaving strips on a horizontal loom which they then sew together. They also 
repair the tent regularly. In remote areas of Wadi Araba or the Hisma, single or 
widowed men who live alone will often choose a rock shelter or cave: a tent 
has little meaning without a female presence.
The symbolic function of the tent, over and above its practical aspect, is that 
of a space where guests can enjoy the hospitality and protection of the master 
of the house, expressed by the preparation and ritualized serving of Arabic 
CONTEXTS | The bedouin today

398
coffee around the central hearth of the public side. This tradition is anchored in 
bedouin values: even when the tent has completely lost its domestic function 
and is erected alongside a house, it still represents the continuation of those 
values and thus of bedouin identity.
The domestic tent is adapted to the social norms that regulate relations 
between men and women and which allow family honour to be preserved. 
However, there are no areas that are reserved exclusively for either sex. 
Movement between the tent's public and private spaces depends on whether 
only close family, or outsiders, are present. The basic rule is that the women 
leave the reception area when guests are present who are not close family 
members. However, the matriarch of the family will always make it her duty to 
receive visitors in the reception area if her husband is absent. In any case, the 
women can listen to conversation from the private side of the tent and take a 
peek through the weave of the partition - a common practice when marriage 
negotiations are being discussed between men.
Associations with the tent remain strong, even in houses (which most 
bedouin own), where the reception area - clearly separated from family space - 
is large and and has a fireplace to serve as a hearth as well as thick curtains 
recalling the tent's partitions. The house's interior is often extended outside, 
with a tent erected nearby.
Today, the poorest bedouin live on the outskirts of towns, or in the most arid 
and rocky zones overlooking the Dead Sea, the Jordan Valley and the Wadi 
Araba. These last real nomads can be recognized by their tents of sewn sack-
cloth, which is cheaper than woven goat hair.
Figures of authority
Photographs of figures of authority are often on display in reception tents 
and salons, cars and offices. Their prominence is a way of demonstrating to 
whom the owner acknowledges authority - and, equally, from whom the 
owner's authority originates. Respect and authority are intimately linked values, 
above all with regard to the respect universally shown to Islam.
Respect for authority is one of the fundamentals of bedouin society, and of 
Arab society in general. The head of the family is required to make decisions 
concerning his wife and children, yet bedouin families are only moderately 
patriarchal: wives, particularly as they get older, take active part in family 
decisions. Bedouin men recognize the importance of female responsibility in 
a traditional lifestyle and many encourage their daughters in academic study and 
professional careers. Nevertheless, the father of the family always retains the right 
of absolute veto on personal choices. Grandfather's photo on display reminds 
everyone of the respect due to him, but also shows that his son - now the head 
of the family - is authorized to exercise domestic authority in his place.
At a higher social level, heads of families recognize the authority of a man to 
whom they are all related. This individual - generally given the title "sheikh" - 
has to represent his kinship group amongst other groups (for example, when 
there are conflicts to resolve) or to outside institutions. He is a mediator, and his 
authority does not replace that of the father of the family, who remains master 
of his own decisions. Adherence by family heads to collective action is not a 
foregone conclusion.
Codes of honour
A sense of honour is an essential masculine quality for the bedouin, to the 
extent that if a man loses his honour, he also loses his right to participate fully 
CONTEXTS | The bedouin today

399
in bedouin society. This explains the efforts that every man makes to maintain 
and increase his honour, and that of his tribe. The welcome of guests has 
resisted changes in lifestyle: a man of honour must be generous - excessively 
so if he can afford it.
He must also be generous with his time - listening to the complaints of 
members of the tribe and others and helping them get a job or a place at 
university, assisting with administrative dealings, mediating between individuals 
or families in conflict. Every bedouin man must respond to a request for assist-
ance even if he does not have the means to do so. This is why bedouin are 
sometimes more apt to "say" than to "do", which upsets only those who don't 
understand their code of honour.
The behaviour of women is also an essential part of family and tribal honour: 
virtue, high morals and respect for the rules of separation between men and 
women are obligatory. Following these rules does not imply meekness or lack 
of character. Many strong female personalities in bedouin society enjoy broad 
respect because they follow the code of honour unfailingly.
Transmissions
Visit a bedouin village and you might have the impression that children have 
free rein, with very few constraints placed on them. In fact, they are living an 
education in which they learn limits for themselves and make the direct experi-
ence of pain and danger - though within a framework: if the parents are absent, 
another member of the community is almost certainly nearby and can exercise 
authority. It is a tough education with no pampering, where from their earliest 
years children become accustomed to the realities that will be their adult lives, 
including familiarity with livestock and the responsibilities of pastoral and 
domestic work.
Children used to be educated by spending time with adults. Nowadays, tradi-
tional methods of transference of knowledge and behaviour compete with 
widespread schooling. Not many bedouin families choose a transhumant life 
for their children when they can send them to school instead. Even the poorest 
families time their seasonal movements to match the school calendar. It is not 
unusual to meet young women or men at university whose illiterate parents still 
live in a tent.
Yet schooling creates a distancing from traditional knowledge. Tribal 
history and the immensely rich oral literature of the bedouin that has been 
transmitted for generations have lost out to new media. Knowledge of animal 
husbandry, of herbal remedies for both humans and animals, of weaving 
techniques, of effective management of water resources are not being passed on. 
While people in wealthy, urbanized countries are rediscovering the importance 
of traditional knowledge, entire swathes of bedouin culture and tradition are 
disappearing largely unregarded. The staged bedouin encounters offered by tour 
operators in the theme park that Wadi Rum has become are a pale reflection of 
genuine bedouin culture.
There is no need to mourn the loss of a difficult way of life (which most of 
those still living it aspire to leave). But one can reflect, with the bedouin 
themselves, on ways of validating and preserving their knowledge and culture.

Themes of alienation and cultural 
displacement - alongside a fine 
evocation of an outsider's view of

through a narrative that shifts 
seamlessly between the present and

Fadia Faqir Pillars of Salt. 
Exceptionally skilful and lyrical

Rambling tales of life in Amman in

Michele Piccirillo The Mosaics of 
Jordan. Eminently learned explication 
of every mosaic to have been 
uncovered in Jordan (as of the early 
1990s), with large, clear photographs 
and massive historical detail. A lavish 
volume, with a JD100 price tag to 
match.
Jane Taylor Petra and the Lost 
Kingdom of the Nabataeans. An 
infectiously enthusiastic evocation of 
the history of Petra and wider 
Nabatean society, liberally scattered 
throughout with the author's 
beautiful photographs. Don't be put 
off by its coffee-table format: this is a 
work as appealing intellectually as 
visually, penetrating the myths 
surrounding the Nabateans with 
clarity and providing unparalleled 
perspective for a visit to their capital.
Jane Taylor Jordan: Images from 
the Air. Beautiful, large-format 
book of aerial photographs of Jordan, 
taken in all seasons and at numerous 
destinations. The images are stunning, 
given added force by the authorita-
tive accompanying text.
Travel
Michael Asher The Last of the Bedu. 
Engrossing tales of epic desert travel, 
seeking to illuminate the myths 
surrounding bedouin culture across 
the whole Middle East from Syria to 
Oman to Sudan. A disappointingly 
skimpy look at the Bdul and 
Howeitat of Jordan doesn't detract 
from the author's uniquely insightful 
empathy with his subject.
Gertrude Bell The Desert and the 
Sown. Hard-to-read account of a 
1905 journey from Jerusalem to 
Antioch. Although concentrating on

the more populated and engaging 
lands in Syria, the book contains 
some interesting vignettes from 
Transjordan.
John Lewis Burckhardt Travels in 
Syria and the Holy Land. Reprint of 
the original 1822 tome, describing a 
massive jaunt around the Levant by a 
pioneer traveller and explorer, who, 
partway through his journey, 
stumbled upon Petra. His style is 
surprisingly and refreshingly upbeat, 
bringing the wildness of Transjordan 
in this period very much to life.
Annie Caulfield Kingdom of the 
Film-Stars. A light, chatty read, as the 
author takes in the sights of Jordan 
against the background of her falling 
in love with a Jordanian man.
Jonathan Raban Arabia. 
Engaging and deeply insightful 
tales of the Gulf States, Yemen, Egypt 
and Jordan in 1978 at the height of 
oil wealth, and before the Lebanese 
civil war and attempts at peace with 
Israel had had much impact on the 
Arab world. Much more than mere 
travelogue, the book is perceptive, 
fluently written and sympathetic, as 
relevant today as when it first 
appeared.
Kathryn Tidrick Heart Beguiling 
Araby. Entertaining analysis of the 
enduring fascination of the English for 
Arabia over the centuries, focused on a

twentieth-century Arabists.

experience in Rum, and containing 
detailed rock-face plans and precise

length guide for dedicated pros.
G. Lankester Harding The Antiqui-
ties of Jordan. Written in 1959 by the 
then British director of the Depart-

the different sites are engagingly well 
written, and photographs often show 
that ancient sites have crumbled 
faster in the last few decades than in 
the previous few centuries.

Arabic
M
any people in Jordan are fluent in English, and many more have a 
working knowledge. However, plain communication isn't necessarily 
the only consideration. Jordanian culture is deeply rooted in the 
verbal complexities of the Arabic language, and being able to 
exchange pleasantries in Arabic, or offer the appropriate response to an Arabic 
greeting, will endear you to people more than anything else. The most halting 
"assalaamu alaykoom" is likely to provoke beams of joy and cries of "You speak 
Arabic better than I do!"
Arabic is phenomenally hard for an English-speaker to learn. There are 
virtually no familiar points of contact between the two languages: the script is 
written in cursive from right to left; there's a host of often guttural sounds 
which take much vocal contortion to master; and the grammar, founded on 
utterly different principles from English, is proclaimed as one of the most 
pedantic in the world.
Briefly, the three forms of Arabic are:
rClassical - the language of the Quran, with many words and forms which 
are now obsolete.
rModern Standard (fuss-ha) - the written language of books and newspapers, 
and the Arabic spoken in news broadcasts and on formal occasions. Identical 
throughout the Arab world and understandable from Morocco to Oman. 
Although most people can read fuss-ha, nobody uses it in everyday life and few 
ordinary people can speak it.
rColloquial (aamayya) - umbrella term for the many dialects of spoken Arabic. 
In Jordan, as in all other Arabic-speaking countries, the colloquial language has 
no proper written form. Pronunciation varies from district to district and, 
furthermore, the vocabulary and verb forms of Jordanian Arabic can be 
markedly different from the related Palestinian, Syrian and Iraqi dialects. Further 
afield, the Arabic spoken in Morocco is a foreign language to Jordanians, who 
find it more or less incomprehensible. Egyptian Arabic is a lingua franca, under-
standable throughout the Arab world because of the prevalence of movies and 
TV soap operas emanating from Cairo.
Very few decent Jordanian Arabic phrasebooks exist; your best bet is the 
excellent teach-yourself course Colloquial Arabic (Levantine) by Leslie 
McLoughlin. The clearest introduction to writing and reading Arabic script
is The Arabic Alphabet by Nicholas Awde and Putros Samano, a slim volume that 
is invaluable for getting a handle on how the language works.
Pronunciation
Throughout this book, Arabic has been transliterated using a common-sense 
what-you-see-is-what-you-say system. However, Arabic vowel-sounds in 
LANGUAGE | 

408
In this book, ay has been written where the Arabic rhymes roughly with "say", 
except where common usage dictates otherwise. Arabic f and s are always soft 
('Muslim' not 'Muzlim'; 'Islam' not 'Izlam'), and r is heavily trilled. Generally 
pronounce an h sound: ahlan (welcome) features a clear and definite exhalation 
of breath, as does mneeh (happy). Where two consonants fall together, pronounce 
them both: hamam means "pigeon" but hammam means "bathroom". The subtle-
ties between the two different kinds of s, t, d, h and th are too rarefied to get 
into here.
Useful words and phrases
Where the form of a word or phrase differs depending on whether the speaker 
is male or female, we've shown this with (m) and (f): to say "I'm sorry", a man 
says "mitaasef", a woman "mitaasfeh". Where the form differs depending on who 
you're speaking to, we've shown the two separated by a slash, with the form for 
addressing a man first, thus: "allah yaafeek/yaafeeki (to a woman)". Note also that 
all words and phrases ending -ak are for addressing a man; if you're addressing a 
woman, substitute -ik.
Greetings are often said in long strings, barely waiting for a response, while 
pumping your interlocutor's hand, and - if you're the same sex - looking him/
her in the eyes. Old friends might also indulge in a complex ritual of double and 
triple kisses on both cheeks, but as a foreigner you won't be roped into this.

LANGUAGE | Useful words and phrases
particular often cannot be rendered accurately in English letters, and stress 
patterns are a minefield - the only way to pick them up is to mimic a native 
speaker. The following are four of the most difficult common sounds:
kh represents the throaty rasp at the end of 
the Scottish "loch".
gh is the same sound as kh, but voiced: it 
sounds like the gargled French "r".
q represents a very guttural k sound made far 
back in the throat; it approximates to the 
sound you might make when imitating the 
glugging of a wine bottle being emptied. In 
some Palestinian accents this becomes an 
unsounded glottal stop (baqlawa becomes 
ba'lawa), while in bedouin areas many 
people change it into a straightforward hard 
g sound (baqlawa becomes baglawa).
aa is especially tricky: constrict your throat 
muscles tightly like you're about to retch, 
open your mouth wide and make a strangu-
lated "aaah" sound. Ridiculous as it feels, 
this is about as close as an English-speaker 
can get, and won't make Jordanians laugh. 
To keep things simple, the sound hasn't 
always been transliterated (it stands at the 
beginning of "Amman", for instance).

ing water-pipe designed to let the smoke 
from the tobacco - which is kept smoul-

A Rough Guide to Rough Guides
Published in 1982, the first Rough Guide - to Greece - was a student scheme 
that became a publishing phenomenon. Mark Ellingham, a recent graduate in 
English from Bristol University, had been travelling in Greece the previous summer 
and couldn't find the right guidebook. With a small group of friends he wrote his 
own guide, combining a highly contemporary, journalistic style with a thoroughly 
practical approach to travellers' needs.
The immediate success of the book spawned a series that rapidly covered dozens 
of destinations. And, in addition to impecunious backpackers, Rough Guides 
soon acquired a much broader and older readership that relished the guides' wit 
and inquisitiveness as much as their enthusiastic, critical approach and value-for-
money ethos. 
These days, Rough Guides include recommendations from shoestring to luxury 
and cover more than 200 destinations around the globe, including almost every 
country in the Americas and Europe, more than half of Africa and most of Asia and 
Australasia. Our ever-growing team of authors and photographers is spread all 
over the world, particularly in Europe, the USA and Australia. 
In the early 1990s, Rough Guides branched out of travel, with the publication of 
Rough Guides to World Music, Classical Music and the Internet. All three have 
become benchmark titles in their fields, spearheading the publication of a wide 
range of books under the Rough Guide name. 
Including the travel series, Rough Guides now number more than 350 titles, 
covering: phrasebooks, waterproof maps, music guides from Opera to Heavy 
Metal, reference works as diverse as Conspiracy Theories and Shakespeare, and 
popular culture books from iPods to Poker. Rough Guides also produce a series of 
more than 120 World Music CDs in partnership with World Music Network.

Help us update
We've gone to a lot of effort to ensure that the 
fourth edition of The Rough Guide to Jordan
is accurate and up-to-date. However, things 
change - places get "discovered", opening hours 
are notoriously fickle, restaurants and rooms raise 
prices or lower standards. If you feel we've got it 
wrong or left something out, we'd like to know, 
and if you can remember the address, the price, 
the hours, the phone number, so much the better. 
Please send your comments with the subject 
line "Rough Guide Jordan Update" to Email
@roughguides.com. We'll credit all contributions 
and send a copy of the next edition (or any other 
Rough Guide if you prefer) for the very best 
emails.

Matthew Teller's ﬁrst visit to the Middle East was in 1980 at the age of 11, when 
he kept nagging to be taken back to Jerusalem's spice market to smell the 
smells. He has since travelled extensively throughout the region and is now 
an award-winning freelance travel journalist based in the UK, specializing in 
writing about the Middle East. He has been a Rough Guide author since 1996.
