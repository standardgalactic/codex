<p>The text discusses several key concepts related to personal growth,
self-awareness, and evolution.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Vertical Development: This term, coined by psychologist Robert
Kegan, refers to a shift in an individual’s cognitive or
social/emotional domain to a higher level of functioning. When this
occurs, what was once part of the subject becomes object to a new,
higher-level self. For instance, thinking and emotions no longer control
the individual but become tools they can choose to engage with or
ignore, depending on the situation.</p></li>
<li><p>Self-Evolving Beings: George Gurdjieff proposed this concept,
referring to individuals who can remake themselves psychologically to
meet future evolutionary needs. They would not be controlled by their
biological and cultural past but could consciously and intentionally
choose actions beneficial for humanity’s future evolution.</p></li>
<li><p>Evolutionary Trajectory: The text suggests that evolution has a
direction or trajectory, which current humanity can identify and align
with to ensure survival and thriving in the long term. This involves
understanding the large-scale evolutionary processes that have shaped
humans and will continue to do so. By aligning with this trajectory,
individuals and societies can evolve in ways that are beneficial for
humanity’s future.</p></li>
<li><p>Evolvability: This term refers to an organism’s ability to
discover and implement changes that enhance its fitness or adaptability.
In the context of evolution, evolvability is a crucial factor in
survival and thriving, as it allows organisms to respond effectively to
changing environments and challenges.</p></li>
<li><p>Practical Consequences: The emergence of self-evolving beings on
Earth would fundamentally change the nature of the evolutionary process.
These individuals would use their capacity for self-evolution to
contribute positively to humanity’s future evolutionary flourishing and
the life on Earth. They would likely pursue strategies that align with
the trajectory of evolution, using their understanding of this direction
to guide their actions and evolution.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the text explores the ideas of vertical development,
self-evolving beings, and evolution’s trajectory. It suggests that by
understanding and aligning with these concepts, individuals can foster
personal growth, self-awareness, and contribute positively to humanity’s
future evolution.</p>
<p>The text discusses the concept of intelligence, superintelligence,
and their vertical and horizontal development. Intelligence is defined
as the capacity to develop and implement strategies that enable the
achievement of particular goals. Superintelligence refers to forms of
intelligence that are far superior at achieving human goals than current
levels of human intelligence.</p>
<p>The author emphasizes that intelligence includes the ability to
implement the strategies developed, not just generating them. Many
individuals struggle with implementing their strategies due to
conflicting motivations and predispositions inherited from biological,
cultural, and social pasts. To act intelligently, humans need to free
themselves from these constraints.</p>
<p>The text distinguishes between horizontal and vertical development.
Horizontal development applies existing levels of intelligence to new
problems solvable at that level, while vertical development involves
emerging a new, higher level of intelligence capable of solving problems
beyond the previous level’s capacity. The European Enlightenment, which
began in the 17th century, is given as an example of vertical
development, leading to scientific, technological, and societal
advancements.</p>
<p>The author argues that the next significant vertical leap in human
intelligence will result in a global Second Enlightenment. This new
level of cognition can be developed intentionally, and its horizontal
development—the use of this higher intelligence to produce scientific
discoveries and technological advancements—will represent its
application to new problems.</p>
<p>It’s essential to note that vertical differences in intelligence and
cognitive abilities are not synonymous with differences in IQ. The text
aims to explain the nature of higher intelligence, its challenges, and
how it can be developed intentionally to drive global progress.</p>
<p>The passage discusses the concept of vertical development, which
involves progressing to higher levels of cognitive intelligence. This
progression is not solely about acquiring knowledge (declarative
knowledge), but also about developing skills and abilities (procedural
knowledge). The author uses the example of learning to hit an effective
serve in tennis, which cannot be mastered through reading a book alone.
Similarly, vertical development at emotional and cognitive levels
requires embodied knowledge that is often indescribable using
language.</p>
<p>The text also highlights the challenge of describing experiences from
higher levels of cognition to those who have not yet awakened or
developed these skills. It explains that individuals in a normal,
unawakened state may find the actions and behaviors of those who are
awake absurd and inexplicable, leading to disparagement or
punishment.</p>
<p>The passage further discusses the rarity of individuals who have
fully awakened in the midst of ordinary life, despite the existence of
spiritual and contemplative traditions with practices intended to
develop this capacity. It suggests that vertical development often
requires more than just reading books or studying theories, as it
involves integrating cognitive abilities with emotional, intuitive, and
even feminine capacities – a metaphorical integration of the left and
right brain, heart and head.</p>
<p>The author implies that the next significant leap in human
intelligence (Second Enlightenment cognition) will necessitate acquiring
both procedural and declarative knowledge, as well as integrating purely
cognitive abilities with emotional, intuitive, and feeling capacities.
This integration is described as a complex process that is not easily
achieved through reading or theoretical study alone, but rather requires
significant effort, practice, and possibly guidance from awakened
individuals or teachers.</p>
<p>The text describes a young student’s journey to improve his
problem-solving skills in physics, particularly after a poor performance
in his first test. The student, aware that his teachers lacked the
necessary strategies, decided to take matters into his own hands. He
devised a plan to identify and adopt effective problem-solving
algorithms used by top students in his class.</p>
<p>The student’s initial approach was to interview these top students,
expecting them to reveal their strategies. However, he found that they
were largely unaware of the mental processes they used to solve
problems. They could demonstrate the steps they took, but not explain
why they chose those specific methods. This lack of insight from his
peers led him to a new strategy: self-reflection.</p>
<p>He began to observe and analyze his own thought processes when
tackling difficult physics problems. He identified successful strategies
and tried to understand why they worked. When a strategy failed, he
sought to understand why and develop an improved version. This process
of continuous reflection, amendment, and improvement of his
problem-solving algorithms is what the student refers to as recursive
self-improvement.</p>
<p>At first, this introspective journey was challenging, with little
immediate progress. However, over time, he became more conscious of his
thought processes and could manipulate them more effectively. He likened
this development to reducing the gap that unconscious intuition would
otherwise have to bridge to solve problems. His ultimate goal was to
maximize the effectiveness of his conscious problem-solving strategies
while minimizing the need for spontaneous, uncontrollable insights.</p>
<p>This narrative underscores the importance of self-awareness and
continuous learning in improving one’s abilities. It also highlights the
student’s proactive approach to overcoming academic challenges, which
involved not just acquiring new knowledge but also refining his thought
processes and problem-solving strategies.</p>
<p>The user’s experience at the University of Queensland, particularly
in the Zoology Department, was marked by a growing disillusionment with
authority structures and academic processes. This dissatisfaction was
not solely limited to his studies but also extended to extracurricular
activities and student governance.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Student Activism: The user was part of the first school council,
which aimed to discuss changes in school policies. They were
particularly interested in abolishing the hat requirement and the
prohibition against long hair. However, their interactions with the
Headmaster, who was highly regarded, revealed his evasiveness and
unwillingness to engage in logical discussions. The Headmaster’s
punitive actions, such as hitting the user with a ruler for not
attending compulsory chapel services, further fueled the user’s disdain
for authority figures who abused their power.</p></li>
<li><p>University-level Activism: The student rebellion of 1969 also
influenced the user’s university experience. He began to challenge the
status quo by standing up in lectures and calling for class
cancellations to participate in anti-Vietnam War demonstrations. This
activism was not limited to protests but also extended to criticisms of
how zoology and evolutionary science were taught in the
university.</p></li>
<li><p>The Zoology Group: In response to these criticisms, a group
consisting of students and academic staff was formed to discuss
potential changes. The user was invited as a prominent second-year
student. However, the meetings were largely ineffective, with trivial
issues like deciding on the correct title for the group (either ‘The
Zoology Group’ or ‘A Zoology Group’) dominating discussions. This
further reinforced the user’s belief in the incompetence and dishonesty
of academic hierarchies.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the user’s university experience was characterized by a
growing skepticism towards authority figures and institutional
processes. His involvement in student activism and his criticisms of
academic practices reflected this disillusionment. The ineffectual
nature of attempts to bring about change within these structures only
served to strengthen his convictions.</p>
<p>The user’s journey in their pursuit of knowledge and understanding of
evolutionary science is detailed in this narrative. Here’s a summary and
explanation of the key points:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>After a brief stint as a government employee in Canberra, the
user returns to university in Brisbane at the age of 23 to complete
their degree in zoology. They aim to eventually pursue a career in
academia as a theoretical evolutionary scientist.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon returning, the user finds that the Zoology Department has
improved since their absence, with more interesting and stimulating
third-year subjects in evolutionary science and ecology. These subjects
cover recent developments, such as Edward O. Wilson’s “Sociobiology: The
New Synthesis,” which applies evolutionary principles to human behavior
and sociality.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite these advancements, the user feels that the existing
theories still fall short of a comprehensive understanding of evolution
that encompasses all aspects of human evolution, including political and
economic systems. They intuit that such a unified theory would require
further vertical transitions in their cognitive abilities.</p></li>
<li><p>The user forms friendships with fellow students who are
passionate about specific aspects of zoology, such as bird watching and
amphibian collection. However, they realize their intellectual interests
differ significantly from their peers, as the students do not share the
user’s theoretical orientation or passion for developing an overarching
understanding of evolution that addresses existential
questions.</p></li>
<li><p>The user also discovers that none of the academic staff in the
Zoology Department shares their theoretical interests. To pursue an
academic career at the University of Queensland, they would need to
focus on data collection through a PhD, which involves spending years
counting and measuring animals—a path not aligned with their aspirations
for a more comprehensive evolutionary theory.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In essence, this passage highlights the user’s evolving intellectual
journey in zoology and evolutionary science, their growing awareness of
the limitations of existing theories, and their determination to pursue
a more unified understanding of evolution that addresses human existence
comprehensively.</p>
<p>The user’s experience as an industrial advocate for a union in
Queensland, Australia, during a period of right-wing, anti-union
government intervention. The advocate’s role involved developing
cost-effective strategies for members in disputes with employers, which
often resulted in strike action. The stakes were high, and the pressure
immense due to the uncertainty of outcomes and potential financial
burden on workers during strikes.</p>
<p>The advocate faced several challenges:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Uncertainty: Strategies had to be continually adapted as opponents
acted unpredictably and developed new tactics.</li>
<li>High costs of strike action: Workers had to survive without pay for
the duration of strikes, with no guarantee of significant concessions
from employers.</li>
<li>Government intervention: The state government often intervened on
behalf of employers, threatening legal action and punitive
measures.</li>
<li>Psychological pressures: Many union leaders reacted to these
challenges by developing alcohol problems, avoiding organizing disputes,
finding scapegoats, or developing a hatred for members.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the user’s strong motivation to succeed,
super-competitiveness, perfectionism, and need for control made this
environment ideal for their cognitive development. They were driven to
excel in their role as an industrial advocate, using what they call
“First Enlightenment thinking,” which is underpinned by
analytical/rational cognition and effective for goal-oriented
problem-solving in analyzable circumstances. This period marked a
significant phase in the user’s life, contributing to their cognitive
growth and development.</p>
<p>The passage describes the author’s experiences and insights gained
from working as a union advocate, organizer, and negotiator. The author
developed advanced strategic thinking skills to navigate complex labor
disputes, but found it challenging to create a comprehensive theory of
evolution due to the demanding nature of union work.</p>
<p>The author’s strategic thinking evolved from analytical reasoning to
metasystemic thinking, which involves understanding and simulating the
structure and dynamics of complex situations involving conflicts of
interest. This development was gradual and required disrupting rigid,
mechanistic thought patterns. The author sought to become more intuitive
and creative, able to perceive large-scale patterns beyond analytical
thinking’s scope.</p>
<p>The author drew inspiration from figures like Gurdjieff,
understanding that disengaging from constant analysis was necessary for
intuitions to arise. However, they lacked a detailed understanding of
how to achieve this state. The author’s intense union work,
characterized by stress and a heavy smoking habit, ultimately led them
to reconsider their career path to focus on developing their theory of
evolution.</p>
<p>The passage highlights the author’s journey from analytical thinking
to metasystemic thinking, emphasizing the importance of intuition,
creativity, and disengagement from constant analysis in understanding
complex phenomena. It also underscores the challenges of balancing
demanding professional pursuits with personal goals and well-being.</p>
<p>The user’s journey involves the development of a comprehensive theory
of evolution, which encompasses both biological and human evolution as
special cases of a more general and abstract process. This theory aims
to explain the evolution of all aspects of humanity, including
political, social, economic systems, psychological evolution, and
intelligence.</p>
<p>The user employs several strategies to develop this theory:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Reading extensively: The user reads widely about large-scale
processes and patterns in evolution, focusing not only on descriptions
but also on attempts to identify the systems-level causal processes that
produce them.</p></li>
<li><p>Holding key unresolved evolutionary problems in mind: The user
maintains several significant evolutionary questions as they read,
hoping these will inspire insights for their new theory. The most
productive of these was to explain how cooperation and altruism could
evolve, given that self-interest is generally expected to prevail in
evolutionary competition. This issue was highlighted by Richard Dawkins
in ‘The Selfish Gene.’</p></li>
<li><p>Seeking a unified theory: The user aims to develop a theory that
can explain both biological and human evolution as special cases of a
more general process. Within this broader framework, gene-based
evolution and cultural evolution might be seen as specific examples of
wider processes. This unified theory could provide a comprehensive
understanding of human evolution, accounting for the evolution of all
aspects of humanity.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The user’s inspiration comes from Teilhard de Chardin’s work, which
proposed a large-scale trend in the evolution of matter and life leading
to progressive integration into larger organizations. However,
Teilhard’s failure to identify plausible causal mechanisms limited the
acceptance of his ideas in modern evolutionary science.</p>
<p>The user’s ultimate goal is to create an overarching framework for
all sciences and humanities, enabling humanity to understand how we need
to evolve to continue surviving and thriving. This comprehensive theory
of evolution would provide insights into the evolution of our political,
social, economic systems, psychological evolution, and intelligence.</p>
<p>The user’s journey from working in government to managing Australia’s
North Eastern Fisheries is detailed as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The user initially worked in a government role, focusing on
evolutionary theorizing while living in Canberra. This location was
chosen to minimize distractions from fishing opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p>The user applied for the position of Manager of Australia’s North
Eastern Fisheries, despite having no prior experience in fisheries
management. The job was based in Canberra, which was seen as an
advantage due to its distance from coastal areas.</p></li>
<li><p>In preparation for the interview, the user highlighted
transferable skills from previous roles and quickly studied fisheries
economics and biology. They also emphasized their experience as a
licensed Master Fisherman.</p></li>
<li><p>After a successful interview, the user was appointed as the
Manager of Australia’s North Eastern Fisheries. This role involved
managing Commonwealth fisheries from Sydney to the Torres Strait,
including commercial and traditional fishing by indigenous
peoples.</p></li>
<li><p>The Torres Strait fisheries were particularly complex due to
overlapping claims between Australia and Papua New Guinea. An
international treaty resolved these claims, prioritizing traditional
fishing by indigenous peoples over commercial fishing. Some parts of the
fisheries were managed solely by Australia, others by PNG, and some
jointly by both nations.</p></li>
<li><p>As the Commonwealth Manager, the user was responsible for
advising national and State Ministers on fishery management, considering
input from a Consultative Committee composed of representatives from
Torres Strait Islanders, commercial fishermen, scientists, and
government managers. For jointly managed fisheries with PNG, regular
travel to PNG was required to resolve management issues.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The user’s transition into this role demonstrates adaptability, quick
learning, and the application of transferable skills in a new context.
The complexity of managing fisheries, especially in the Torres Strait,
highlights the challenges and nuances involved in this position.</p>
<p>The text describes the author’s experience working as a policy
development job in the Department of Industrial Relations after three
years as a fisheries manager. The work was not very demanding, allowing
him to complete tasks well within the required hours. However, despite
his efforts to handle issues fairly and effectively, he felt insulated
from the consequences of his policies due to his bureaucratic role in
Canberra.</p>
<p>The author, a perfectionist, found high-level policy development less
stressful than his previous work, likening it to dropping atomic bombs
on Hiroshima - causing harm without experiencing it firsthand. Despite
this, he felt pressure to make tangible progress with his evolutionary
thinking, as he had not yet developed anything publishable in a
peer-reviewed scientific journal at the age of 40.</p>
<p>To enhance his ‘big picture’ thinking and promote creative ideas, the
author decided to practice a form of meditation. He was drawn to
meditation’s potential for disrupting analytical/rational cognition,
fostering intuitive forms of knowing, and deepening his ability to
examine his own thinking objectively. This capacity was crucial for
recursively improving his cognitive abilities and identifying
inadequacies in his current thinking.</p>
<p>The author also explored the connection between meditation and
Gurdjieff’s self-observation technique, which he had used to some extent
for self-mastery and overcoming cravings. He found that mindfulness
practices were more accessible than Gurdjieff’s techniques. The author
emphasized that his interest in meditation was purely practical, aiming
to enhance his effectiveness in the world rather than pursuing spiritual
development.</p>
<p>Gurdjieff’s philosophy appealed to him due to its focus on
self-mastery and tools for achieving it, with a central aim of ‘waking
up’ in ordinary life. The author sought capacities that would enable him
to be more effective in realizing his goals, rather than engaging in
spiritual pursuits.</p>
<p>The text describes a shift in the author’s approach to paid work,
particularly in their role as an industrial relations policy developer.
Prior to 1992, the author’s primary goal was to fulfill the
responsibilities of the job as assigned by their superiors. However,
after making this decision, their overriding objective became the
development of a new theory of evolution and identifying its
implications for humanity.</p>
<p>To achieve this new goal, the author began to manipulate their work
environment and the system they were embedded in. They no longer
accepted that their superiors could require them to do whatever work
they decided. Instead, they used their strategizing abilities and
persuasive capacities to control the kind and amount of work they were
given.</p>
<p>The author continued to take on projects where they could control
what was done, such as major test cases conducted by State and
Commonwealth arbitration tribunals. They took responsibility for
drafting the Government’s submissions and presenting them to tribunal
hearings as the Government’s advocate. These cases could involve more
than six months of intensive work, and as the only person in the
Department who knew the details, the author was well-positioned to
control what their superiors expected them to do.</p>
<p>To avoid excessive work that would detract from the quality and
effectiveness of their submissions, the author often did not get
specific approval for the details from their Departmental superiors or
the Minister’s Office. They gave the impression that the details had
already been approved by higher-ups, knowing that this was a risk but
judging that they could get away with it at least once. If caught, they
planned to apologize profusely and claim they thought they were
operating within established policy positions.</p>
<p>Despite this manipulation, the author continued to perform at a very
high level any work they could not avoid. Given their extensive
experience and recursive improvement of cognitive capacities, they
achieved outcomes that were a quantum level better than anyone else in
the Department. This approach allowed them to dedicate sufficient time
and mental energy to their new goal of developing a new theory of
evolution while still fulfilling their professional duties.</p>
<p>The text discusses the evolution of complex, cooperative human
societies, focusing on two main types: externally-managed societies and
internally-governed tribal societies.</p>
<p>Externally-managed societies are organized by powerful external
entities, such as governments or rulers, that have the authority to
reward cooperation and punish non-cooperation. Examples include complex
human societies throughout history, corporations, and even early tribal
societies that were managed by external leaders like kings or
chieftains. In these societies, governance is external to the
individuals being managed, making it clear that management originates
from an outside source.</p>
<p>The emergence and evolution of externally-managed societies can be
understood through the history of the Mongols in the 12th and 13th
centuries. Initially, they were a collection of warring tribes. However,
under Genghis Khan’s leadership, they adopted a predatory strategy of
raiding and pillaging other societies for resources. This approach had
limitations, as a complex society could only be plundered once before
needing years to recover.</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations, some Mongols discovered an alternative
strategy: governing conquered societies indefinitely, allowing them to
extract resources continuously. This shift from predation to governance
is analogous to the human transition from hunting wild animals to
domestication. By managing societies, governors can ensure a steady
stream of resources without depleting the society’s capacity for
long-term growth.</p>
<p>In managed, cooperative societies, governance aligns the interests of
citizens with those of the managers/governors. When individuals pursue
their self-interest within such a system, they inadvertently contribute
to the society’s overall well-being. Consequently, managed societies
have the potential to outcompete non-cooperative societies.</p>
<p>However, not all complex human cooperation can be explained by
external management. Early tribal societies were hierarchical and lacked
an external source of power governing their members. Instead,
cooperation within these societies was maintained through internal
governance distributed among tribe members. The mechanisms behind this
form of self-governance remain less understood and will be explored
later in the text.</p>
<p>In summary, complex human societies have evolved through two primary
organizational structures: externally-managed systems, where governance
originates from an outside source, and internally-governed tribal
societies, where self-governance is distributed among members. The
Mongol example illustrates how societies transitioned from predatory
strategies to managed governance for sustained resource extraction.</p>
<p>The text discusses the concept of systemic architecture and
management in the context of evolutionary transitions, particularly
focusing on the origin of life. The author draws parallels between the
emergence of life’s systemic architecture and global management that
creates cooperative societies.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Systemic Architecture: This refers to the organizational
structure that enables cooperation and adaptation in biological systems.
In the context of the origin of life, it is the systemic arrangement
that overcame the “cooperation barrier” at the molecular level, allowing
self-producing molecular organizations to emerge and evolve as coherent
wholes.</p></li>
<li><p>Management: The text uses the term “management” metaphorically to
describe the processes that enabled the incorporation of a wider range
of catalysts into proto-metabolisms and supported processes that
inhibited free-riding. This management, carried out by RNA,
significantly increased the evolvability of these molecular
organizations.</p></li>
<li><p>Cooperative Evolutionary Transitions: These are major shifts in
evolutionary history where cooperation becomes a significant factor. The
author suggests that similar dynamical architectures explain these
transitions, including the origin of life.</p></li>
<li><p>Abstract Functional Equivalence: The author posits an abstract
functional equivalence between the systemic architecture that emerged at
the origins of life and global management in human societies. This means
that the principles governing cooperation and adaptation in biological
systems can be understood using the same frameworks as those used to
study human-made cooperative societies.</p></li>
<li><p>Historical Analogy: The text uses the historical example of
gravity to illustrate how a concept can transition from
unintelligibility to obviousness. Before Galileo’s discovery, there was
no perceived relationship between celestial movements and terrestrial
gravity. However, once the abstract equivalence was recognized, it
became obvious. The author suggests that the same process applies to
understanding the mechanisms behind cooperative evolutionary
transitions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In essence, the text argues that the principles governing the
emergence of life and complex societies are fundamentally similar. Both
involve overcoming barriers to cooperation through effective management
or systemic architecture. This unified perspective can help us
understand not just the origin of life, but also other major
evolutionary transitions and perhaps even human-made cooperative
systems.</p>
<p>The user’s text discusses a scientific paper authored by the author,
which explores the concept of evolutionary mechanisms and their
evolvability. The paper focuses on the advantages of sexual reproduction
over asexual reproduction in terms of adaptability to environmental
changes.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Sexual reproduction vs. asexual reproduction: The paper argues
that sexual reproduction is more effective than asexual reproduction in
adapting organisms to new circumstances. This is because sexual
reproduction combines existing genes and shuffles them through a process
called recombination, creating novel gene combinations. In contrast,
asexual reproduction relies solely on random mutations, which are less
efficient and wasteful in discovering adaptive advantages.</p></li>
<li><p>Environmental impact: The paper demonstrates that even if a
species is not encountering a changing environment, sexual reproduction
can still outcompete an emerging clone. This is because the growth and
success of the clone itself alter the environment faced by the organism,
providing an adaptive advantage to sexually reproducing
individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>Evolutionary evolution: The paper introduces the idea that
evolution itself evolves, with mechanisms for discovering and
implementing adaptations improving over time. This recursive improvement
in evolvability is a central aspect of the trajectory of
evolution.</p></li>
<li><p>Historical context: The author provides historical context by
discussing earlier stages of evolution, such as autocatalytic sets
(self-producing organizations of molecular processes) and RNA-like
managers. These early forms had limited evolvability, which was
significantly enhanced by the emergence of digital exploration
possibilities through random changes in a genetic code.</p></li>
<li><p>Major transitions: The author highlights sexual reproduction as a
major transition in evolutionary mechanisms’ ability to discover and
implement effective adaptations. This transition allowed for a broader
exploration of possibility space, which is crucial for the continued
improvement of evolvability.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the paper argues that sexual reproduction is more
adaptable than asexual reproduction due to its ability to create novel
gene combinations through recombination. This advantage allows sexually
reproducing organisms to better adapt to changing environments and even
outcompete emerging clones. The paper also emphasizes the recursive
improvement of evolvability throughout evolutionary history, with major
transitions like the emergence of sexual reproduction playing a crucial
role in this process.</p>
<p>The text describes the author’s journey towards developing an
evolutionary theory and its implications for humanity. The author, a
scientist, found that his work hours were insufficient for writing a
book on this topic. Therefore, he applied for and was granted long
service leave by the Australian government, allowing him a year of
half-pay leave to write.</p>
<p>The author’s evolutionary theory aims to explore how our
understanding of ethical and moral principles will change as human
cognitive capacities evolve. Historically, norms and morals played a
crucial role in fostering cooperation within tribal societies. These
principles were ingrained through socialization, religious systems, and
genetic predispositions, enabling complex group cooperation. Societies
that effectively managed their internal affairs with better norms and
morals had a competitive advantage in inter-tribal competition.</p>
<p>However, the author argues that as human cognitive abilities increase
due to evolution, ethical and moral principles will become less
important. This is because the effectiveness of these principles relies
on being hardwired across society members. If individuals could change
their norms and morals at will, it might lead to societal disaster.</p>
<p>In essence, the author’s theory suggests that as humans evolve and
gain more cognitive abilities, our reliance on traditional ethical and
moral principles for social organization may diminish. This shift could
fundamentally alter how we understand ourselves and shape human behavior
in the future. The author plans to delve deeper into this topic and
other implications of his evolutionary theory in his book, tentatively
titled ‘Evolution’s Arrow: The Direction of Evolution and the Future of
Humanity.’</p>
<p>The text discusses the transition from unconscious to conscious
evolution, driven by the acquisition of metasystemic cognition
(superintelligence) and self-evolution capacity in humans. This shift
will significantly alter the evolutionary process on Earth, moving it
from a blind, past-focused mechanism to a conscious one that anticipates
future demands.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Unconscious vs. Conscious Evolution: Previously, evolution
occurred largely without foresight or conscious direction, relying on
random genetic mutations subjected to natural selection over
generations. This gene-based mechanism is slow and inefficient,
requiring many organisms to be eliminated for complex adaptations to
emerge. In contrast, the proposed transition involves humans actively
shaping their evolution through metasystemic cognition, enabling rapid
and intentional adaptation.</p></li>
<li><p>Metasystemic Cognition: This refers to the ability of a system
(in this case, humans) to understand, model, and improve upon its own
structure and function. It allows humans to think about their thoughts,
create mental simulations of potential adaptations, and implement
changes based on these simulations—all much faster than genetic
evolution.</p></li>
<li><p>Self-Evolution Capacity: This concept refers to humans’ ability
to consciously modify themselves and their societies in response to
changing circumstances. It involves recognizing and addressing the need
for adaptation proactively, rather than passively waiting for natural
selection to act upon random genetic variations.</p></li>
<li><p>Impact on Human Desires and Motivations: The text suggests that
our current desires and motivations are largely shaped by evolutionary
history, creating an “illusion” or “Maya” that controls our behavior.
This illusion is compared to Eastern spiritual traditions’ concept of
Maya (illusion) and Plato’s allegory of the cave (mistaking shadows for
reality). The author argues that recognizing this illusion is crucial
for transcending it and moving toward more purposeful, conscious
evolution.</p></li>
<li><p>Ethical and Moral Implications: The transition to conscious
self-evolution will not only affect the speed and direction of human
adaptation but also reshape ethics and morality. As humans gain the
ability to proactively shape their future, they must consider how to use
this power responsibly and ethically.</p></li>
<li><p>Immediate Action Required: The text emphasizes that this
transition is not a distant future scenario but an ongoing process. It
calls for immediate action from individuals to ensure humanity’s
survival and successful evolution into the future. This may involve
various adaptations at personal, societal, and global levels, which will
be explored in more detail later.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the text presents a compelling argument for humans’
capacity to consciously guide their evolution, driven by metasystemic
cognition and self-evolution capabilities. This transition promises
faster adaptation than traditional genetic evolution but also raises
critical questions about human desires, motivations, ethics, and the
need for immediate action.</p>
<p>The user is sharing their personal journey and insights into
meditation practices that lead to a state of presence or “awakening.”
They began with an effective meditation practice and developed the
ability to come into the present at will during ordinary life.</p>
<p>They attended a school that taught a practice called “being here
now,” which involved giving bare, surrendered attention to sensations
and bringing attention back to them whenever thoughts or feelings arose.
This practice helped still the mind and bring the practitioner into the
present.</p>
<p>The user noticed common principles underlying various practices they
used, read about, and those taught by the school. They realized that
these practices all involved resting attention on something that
occupies and attracts attention but does not evoke thinking or feeling.
This stillness of mind allows for spacious awareness and detailed
perceptions.</p>
<p>The user identified two main methods for achieving this state:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Resting bare, surrendered attention on sensations: By focusing on
sensations like the breath, feelings in legs, or visualized images, one
can maintain a still mind and spacious awareness. The key is to return
attention to these sensations whenever thoughts or feelings arise,
preventing re-embedding in thought or feeling.</p></li>
<li><p>Surrendering all goals, intentions, and motivations: By letting
go of intentions and motivations that would otherwise generate thoughts
and feelings, the mind becomes still. This method can be more effective
than focusing on sensations alone because it addresses the underlying
causes of thought and feeling.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Both methods utilize the fundamental principle of meditation
practice: moving attention gently and non-judgmentally back to attention
and/or surrender when re-embedded in thought or feeling. This repetition
strengthens the capacity for dis-embedding and maintaining a state of
presence.</p>
<p>In summary, the user’s experience and analysis suggest that various
meditation practices lead to a state of presence by stilling the mind
through focused, non-judgmental attention on sensations or
intentions/motivations. This stillness allows for spacious awareness,
detailed perceptions, and a deeper understanding of one’s
consciousness.</p>
<p>The text describes an event called the Evolutionary Salon, which was
intended to bring together spiritual and social progressives, as well as
evolutionary scientists, to discuss large-scale evolutionary processes
and their implications for humanity. The author’s primary goal was to
engage in systematic intellectual discussions with the scientists about
his book, Evolution’s Arrow, which presents an evolutionary
worldview.</p>
<p>However, the scientists pulled out of the event, leaving a group of
attendees who were more “heart” or “feeling” oriented, rather than
“head” or “thinking.” This imbalance resulted in a lack of heavy-duty
thinking and new insights into large-scale evolutionary processes.
Although the participants found Evolution’s Arrow inspiring due to its
positive message about increasing cooperation and integration in
evolution, many did not fully understand its central themes.</p>
<p>The author explains that his book details the mechanisms evolution
uses to overcome barriers to cooperation, such as the emergence of
powerful managers who punish free-riders and reward cooperation. These
processes are not as uplifting but are necessary for understanding
complex cooperation’s evolution. Despite the lack of systematic
intellectual engagement at the Salon, the author continues to develop
scientific support for an evolutionary worldview through writing
academic papers.</p>
<p>In summary, the Evolutionary Salon was intended to be a platform for
intellectual discussions about evolution and its implications for
humanity. However, the absence of scientists and the prevalence of
“heart” or “feeling” oriented attendees resulted in a lack of systematic
thinking and new insights. The author’s book, Evolution’s Arrow,
presents an inspiring evolutionary worldview but also discusses less
uplifting mechanisms that drive complex cooperation’s evolution. Despite
the Salon’s limitations, the author persists in building scientific
support for this worldview through academic writing.</p>
<p>The passage discusses the concept of non-dual experience, a state of
consciousness where one’s sense of self and its separation from the
environment is diminished or absent. This phenomenon can be explained by
the Phenomenal Models of the Self (PMS) and the Phenomenal Model of the
Intentionality Relation (PMIR), which are representations of the self
and its point of view in consciousness, respectively.</p>
<p>In a typical meditation practice, individuals drop attachment to
thoughts and feelings, leading to spacious, expanded awareness. However,
non-dual experience involves going beyond this, dropping the PMS and
PMIR from consciousness. This results in a conscious experience that no
longer distinguishes between self and other, leading to an experience of
oneness or unity with the divine.</p>
<p>Philosopher Thomas Metzinger’s model suggests that these phenomena
can be understood through the lens of representation in consciousness.
The PMS and PMIR are representations of the self and its point of view,
respectively. When these models are dropped from consciousness, a
non-dual experience arises.</p>
<p>This model also explains other forms of conscious experience. For
instance, a rugby player might experience himself as being above his
body during a game, seeing the field from a different perspective that
enhances his decision-making and performance. Similarly, psychedelic
drugs can temporarily disrupt these models, leading to experiences of
dying or non-dual consciousness, before the effects wear off and normal
self-awareness returns.</p>
<p>In summary, non-dual experience is a state of consciousness where the
usual sense of self and its separation from the environment are
diminished or absent. This can be understood through Metzinger’s model,
which posits that representations of the self (PMS) and its point of
view (PMIR) in consciousness are crucial for our typical experience of a
separate self. Dropping these models can lead to non-dual experiences,
which can also be observed in certain states like meditation or
psychedelic use.</p>
<p>The text discusses the limitations of analytical/rational thinking,
also known as mechanistic mental models, in understanding complex
phenomena. This type of thinking is characterized by analyzable
structures, fixed rules, and the ability to be thought through. It has
been the foundation for designing our built environment, which often
consists of right angles, boxes, and flat surfaces, such as buildings
and vehicles.</p>
<p>However, most of reality, particularly natural environments like
forests, cannot be adequately understood or modeled using mechanistic
thinking due to their inherent complexity and constant change. The text
introduces the concept of metasystemic cognition, which is the ability
to understand and model such complex phenomena.</p>
<p>The author then presents a resource, “Manual of Dialectical Thought
Forms” by Otto Laske, as a tool for scaffolding metasystemic cognition
in analytical/rational thinkers. This manual identifies thought forms or
aspects that are often missing from mechanistic models but are crucial
for understanding complexity. These include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Context: Considering the broader environment or circumstances
surrounding the phenomenon being modeled.</li>
<li>Processes over objects: Representing certain elements within the
model as dynamic processes rather than static objects with fixed
attributes.</li>
<li>Co-evolving relationships: Including interactions and mutual
influences between different elements in the model.</li>
<li>Systems-in-transformation: Modeling phenomena as dynamic systems
that change over time, rather than static entities.</li>
</ol>
<p>The author emphasizes that while metasystemic thinking involves
incorporating these additional aspects, it does not require using every
thought form for every model. Models should still strive to be as simple
as possible, given their purposes.</p>
<p>Individuals can use Laske’s declarative knowledge about model
building to help develop their metasystemic cognition, while coaches can
use this knowledge to guide others in the same process. This scaffolding
involves learning to identify deficiencies in mechanistic models and
incorporating the missing aspects identified by the thought forms. The
result is a more comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena.</p>
<p>The text discusses the concept of a “Second Enlightenment,” which is
an intentional effort to spread metasystemic/dialectical cognition
globally. This idea emerged from the understanding that the First
Enlightenment, characterized by the rise of analytical thinking, was not
systematically planned or implemented. Instead, it occurred
spontaneously over centuries.</p>
<p>The author, who possesses metasystemic cognition and
self-transformative practices, argues that this time, the process should
be intentional due to the urgency of global challenges that require
complex understanding and management. He proposes that economic forces
will eventually take over, but until then, conscious planning is
necessary.</p>
<p>To achieve this, he organizes a “First Planning Meeting for the
Second Enlightenment” with a select group of individuals who possess two
key characteristics: metasystemic cognition and a history of
self-transformation through practices like meditation. These individuals
are capable of constructing complex mental models to identify strategies
for spreading metasystemic cognition and have the experiential knowledge
to understand and develop self-scaffolding processes in others.</p>
<p>The author emphasizes that mere meditation practice is insufficient
for this purpose. Most Western meditators use it for stress reduction,
spiritual experiences, or calmness rather than cognitive enhancement or
self-evolution. Therefore, participants must have a proven track record
of intentional self-transformation.</p>
<p>The meeting aims to address critical questions: What new ways of
thinking enable understanding and managing complex challenges? Can these
ways of thinking be trained in others? And if so, what strategies will
spread them effectively across the planet before global crises undermine
civilization?</p>
<p>In summary, the author advocates for an intentional, global effort to
spread metasystemic cognition, a level of thinking that allows
understanding and managing complex systems. This effort is planned
through strategic meetings involving individuals with advanced cognitive
abilities and self-transformative practices. The goal is to develop and
disseminate strategies and techniques that can scaffold metasystemic
cognition in others before it’s too late to mitigate global crises.</p>

<li><p>Origins of Life: The paper titled “Evolutionary Management Theory
and the Origin of Life” (Stewart, 2019a) proposes an explanation for the
origins of life using Evolutionary Management Theory (EMTh). EMTh
suggests that life emerged as a result of a self-organizing process
driven by the evolutionary imperative to maximize energy capture and
conversion. The author argues that this perspective provides a better
explanation than group selectionism, another theory proposed by David
Sloan Wilson.</p></li>
<li><p>Evolution of Consciousness: The paper titled “Evolutionary
Management Theory and the Evolution of Consciousness” (Stewart, in
progress) outlines a theory of consciousness evolution using EMTh. This
theory identifies a minimally complex subsystem capable of giving rise
to conscious experience. The proposed architecture and functioning of
this subsystem are detailed and explained in the paper.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Both papers aim to strengthen the scientific foundations of the
evolutionary worldview by solving major problems that have been
intractable for science so far. By demonstrating the applicability and
explanatory power of EMTh in these areas, the author hopes to increase
acceptance of the evolutionary worldview within the scientific
community.</p>
<p>The evolutionary worldview outlines three primary trends that have
shaped life on Earth over 3.5 billion years: diversification,
integration, and increasing evolvability.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Diversification: Life began as simple cooperative organizations
of molecular processes. As evolution progressed, these entities
diversified into numerous forms, each adapted to specific environments.
This specialization allowed life to spread across the planet, taking on
various forms and functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Integration: The first significant step in the integration of
living processes occurred when simple cells formed cooperatives. These
collaborations enabled cells to work together, leading to more complex
organisms. This trend of progressive integration has continued,
resulting in ever-larger cooperative organizations of living
processes.</p></li>
<li><p>Increasing Evolvability: As life became more diverse and
integrated, it also became more adaptable and capable of evolving. This
increased evolvability allowed life to respond to changing environments
and challenges more effectively. The trend of growing diversification,
integration, and evolvability has been the driving force behind the
trajectory of evolution on Earth.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding these evolutionary processes is crucial for humanity’s
survival and flourishing. Analytical/rational thinking alone cannot
adequately address the complex challenges we face. Metasystemic
cognition, which involves building dynamic mental models of our
environment, is essential for navigating this complex future. It enables
us to predict how processes will evolve and develop, allowing us to act
accordingly to ensure our continued existence and prosperity.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The text discusses the concept of global entities, which are
living organisms on a planetary scale. This idea is based on the
observation that life tends to diversify and integrate across a planet,
eventually leading to the emergence of a coherent whole.</p></li>
<li><p>The author suggests that this process is not unique to Earth but
is likely to occur on other planets with suitable conditions for life.
The architecture of these transitions, from single cells to global
entities, may vary in details but follows a similar pattern across
different planets.</p></li>
<li><p>The development of global entities involves a process of
entification, where they gain the capacity to adapt and evolve as
coherent wholes. This process is compared to embryonic development, with
structures and processes growing in scale until a global organism
emerges.</p></li>
<li><p>Once global entities develop the ability to adapt and evolve for
the outside/future (i.e., on a planetary or interplanetary scale), they
begin to communicate and form cooperative organizations. These
larger-scale entities have goals that are currently unimaginable to us,
just as our complex social and emotional lives are beyond the
understanding of bacteria in our gut.</p></li>
<li><p>The author emphasizes the importance of destructive competition
at the level of nation-states in driving humanity to develop effective
global governance. This process cannot be easily circumvented through
external intervention, as it is an essential part of learning and
development for global entities.</p></li>
<li><p>The text is inspired by the evolutionary worldview, which posits
that life follows predictable patterns across different planets due to
the universal nature of the processes involved in emergence,
diversification, integration, and cooperation. This perspective suggests
that the universe may be set up to develop and hatch global entities on
suitable planets.</p></li>
<li><p>The author uses metasystemic cognition as a framework for
observing and understanding these processes across time and space.
Metasystemic cognition refers to the ability to think about and
understand complex systems at higher levels of abstraction, allowing us
to grasp the developmental trajectory of global entities and their
eventual emergence.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The passage describes a personal experience of the author, who, upon
discovering his grandson William might be on the autism spectrum,
becomes deeply involved in finding a solution. The author researches
early interventions for autism, which typically involve extensive
therapy (around 15 hours per week) starting at around 12 months of age.
However, in Australia, diagnosing a child with autism before two or
three years is challenging due to limited availability of
paediatricians.</p>
<p>The author manages to secure William’s participation in a highly
sought-after government-funded program for autistic children. This
program not only diagnoses William immediately but also provides him
with 15 hours of intensive therapy delivered by a multi-disciplinary
team at the child care center three days a week.</p>
<p>During this time, the author is consumed by worry and fails to apply
the psychological skills they’ve developed to maintain distance from
their concerns. Their primary focus is on protecting Libby and William
from potential pain and hardships. Despite these challenges, the
intervention proves successful, with William transitioning from being a
“head-banger” to attending a mainstream school as a six-year-old, with
his autism no longer being noticeable to others.</p>
<p>This experience underscores the importance of early intervention in
managing autism and highlights the author’s emotional investment in
their grandson’s wellbeing. The passage also illustrates the author’s
personal growth during this period, as they reflect on their ability to
apply psychological skills to manage stress and worry more
effectively.</p>
<p>The text describes the author’s experience with depression, which he
attributes to his daughters’ rejection of him. Despite initially
believing he had come to terms with this situation, he spends a
significant amount of time at a mental health clinic reflecting on it,
leading to increased emotional intensity.</p>
<p>The author, who identifies as being on the autism spectrum,
acknowledges that his perfectionism and control-freak tendencies may be
contributing factors to his depression. He also recognizes the
importance of positive relationships and community support in mental
well-being, which contrasts with his lifelong tendency towards
isolation.</p>
<p>During his stay at the clinic, the author undergoes various
therapies, including mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. These
sessions help him identify self-destructive thought patterns, such as
catastrophizing, a common trait among individuals with autism.</p>
<p>The author’s reflections on his past reveal that he has never
experienced grief, even during significant losses in his life. This
realization further fuels his introspection about the causes of his
depression and his relationship with his daughters.</p>
<p>In summary, the text explores the author’s struggle with depression,
its potential roots in his personality traits and interpersonal
relationships, and the therapeutic approaches he engages with to
understand and manage his condition.</p>
<p>The text discusses the potential cognitive advantages of autism,
particularly in the context of metasystemic cognition. Metasystemic
cognition refers to the ability to control and manipulate complex
circumstances, which goes beyond analytical/rational cognition that can
only model a small proportion of the environment.</p>
<p>The author, who has researched this topic, found that individuals
with autism are incentivized to develop high-level analytical/rational
thinking due to challenges they face in social situations. However,
these forces do not cease once analytical/rational cognition is
achieved; instead, they propel further development towards metasystemic
cognition.</p>
<p>The author personally experienced this when he found that to achieve
his goals, he had to integrate right-brain capacities with his
left-brain analytical thinking, leading to a higher level of cognitive
synthesis. This integration allowed him to construct mental models of
complex phenomena and control complex circumstances where possible.</p>
<p>The text also highlights the literary prowess of James Joyce as an
example of autistic individuals’ potential for complex mental modeling.
Joyce’s innovative use of literary devices suggests a conscious effort
to craft specific effects, demonstrating the application of declarative
understanding in combination with right-brain capacities.</p>
<p>The author posits that this propensity of autistic individuals to
develop more complex mental models is significant for the spread of
metasystemic cognition across humanity and the emergence of a Second
Enlightenment. Autistic individuals are likely to lead in developing
strategies for scaffolding metasystemic cognition, including practices
that enable the integration of ‘right brain’ capacities necessary for
higher cognition. These strategies will be detailed in the book’s final
chapters.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The text discusses the development of human-level intelligence,
focusing on the learning experiences and interactions that contribute to
this process. It highlights that while we know a great deal about how
human intelligence develops, our understanding is still
limited.</p></li>
<li><p>The foundations of cognitive and social-emotional development in
humans are established in the first year of life through long sequences
of interactions with primary caregivers, typically parents or other
family members. These interactions broaden into complex processes of
socialization involving wider communities.</p></li>
<li><p>Formal education, such as pre-school, kindergarten, and
university, plays a significant role in developing cognitive and
social/emotional knowledge and capacities necessary for well-paid work
in modern economic systems. However, informal learning experiences, like
play and interactions with peers before and during school, are also
crucial in developing various skills.</p></li>
<li><p>The specific sequences and networks of experiences that prove
essential for enabling a particular career cannot be planned in advance.
Many skills and capacities that prove significant in our lives are
acquired through chance meetings with individuals from different
environments or even different countries and cultures.</p></li>
<li><p>Failures, traumas, abusive relationships, and mental illness may
also contribute to the development of resilience and adaptability, which
can be beneficial in shaping one’s life path.</p></li>
<li><p>The text suggests that understanding how human-level intelligence
develops in humans could provide insights into creating artificial
general intelligences (AGI). However, our current knowledge about this
process is limited, and there is no established strategy for producing
AGI beyond wishful thinking and unproven methods.</p></li>
<li><p>The text also explores the possibility of programming AI directly
with capacities that humans learn through experiences and interactions.
This could potentially short-circuit current methods of producing
human-level intelligence in AI. However, our understanding of how to do
this is still in its infancy, as we have limited knowledge about how to
develop human-level intelligence in humans.</p></li>
<li><p>The text concludes by noting that despite the many years of human
development and the countless interactions and learning experiences
involved, our understanding of the specific factors contributing to the
successful development of human intelligence remains limited. This
highlights the need for further research and exploration in this
area.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The text discusses the author’s exploration of the meaning and
purpose of life, particularly focusing on suffering and existential
questions. The author employs a rational approach to consider various
hypotheses about existence, inspired by French mathematician and
philosopher Blaise Pascal’s reasoning about the Christian God. However,
the author criticizes Pascal’s method for its narrow focus and lack of
consideration for other plausible religious traditions.</p>
<p>The author then applies this rational approach to their own life,
deciding to endure and learn from suffering. They believe that suffering
may provide valuable learning experiences and motivation for personal
development. Furthermore, by developing the capacity to accept
circumstances fully, one can become more resilient, like a Buddhist monk
facing adversity without reacting negatively.</p>
<p>The author acknowledges that the idea of life being a temporary
experience intended for learning is common across various spiritual and
religious traditions. However, they criticize these beliefs for their
often contradictory explanations and justifications. Instead, they
advocate for understanding these concepts rationally rather than relying
on spiritual mumbo-jumbo.</p>
<p>The author’s realization that science may not provide answers to all
existential questions does not lead them to abandon such inquiries. They
recognize that the absence of scientific evidence does not rule out
other possible explanations for existence. Consequently, they remain
open to various possibilities regarding life after death, acknowledging
that uncertainty should not dictate their approach to dying or
living.</p>
<p>In summary, the author employs a rational and open-minded approach to
explore existential questions, particularly focusing on suffering and
the meaning of life. They draw inspiration from Pascal’s reasoning while
criticizing its limitations. The author endorses learning from
suffering, accepting circumstances, and maintaining an open-minded
perspective on life after death despite the lack of scientific evidence
or certainty.</p>
<p>The author addresses the challenge of conveying the understanding
required for metasystemic cognition, a skill that involves complex
mental models and dynamic processes. This Catch-22 arises because only
individuals with metasystemic cognition can fully grasp the intricacies
of its development. To overcome this, the author employs a narrative
structure, detailing their personal journey from analytical/rational
thinking to metasystemic cognition.</p>
<p>This approach serves multiple purposes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It provides a gradual introduction to new concepts and
understandings, making them more accessible to readers who are not yet
equipped with metasystemic cognition.</li>
<li>It offers a structured outline of key steps for developing this
skill, enabling analytical/rational thinkers to follow a path towards
metasystemic thinking.</li>
<li>The narrative format allows the author to convey procedural
knowledge, skills, and practices that cannot be easily described in
words.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the author acknowledges that some experiences and states
necessary for understanding metasystemic cognition cannot be captured in
words or conveyed through declarative propositions and explanations
alone. This limitation is inherent in the nature of the knowledge
itself, much of which is procedural and experiential.</p>
<p>In summary, the author’s strategy to communicate the development of
metasystemic cognition involves a personal narrative that gradually
introduces complex concepts and practices. This approach aims to make
the journey towards higher-level thinking more comprehensible and
accessible to readers who may not yet possess metasystemic
cognition.</p>
<p>The passage discusses the concept of “dis-embedding” from thoughts,
emotions, and other feelings, which is a state often sought after in
religious and spiritual traditions. This state is described as a
peaceful and enjoyable experience, where one can view their previous
behavior from a wider perspective, often finding it absurd or
nonsensical from this new vantage point.</p>
<p>The process of achieving this state is likened to awakening from a
dream, as in the dream state, awareness is embedded and absorbed by the
dream’s logic, much like our normal waking life where we are often
jerked around by thoughts and emotions. However, when we awaken from
sleep, we can reflect on our dream behavior from a broader context and
see its absurdity. Similarly, when we dis-embed from thinking and
feeling, we can view our previous actions with a wider perspective and
find them lacking in sense or appropriateness.</p>
<p>Religious and spiritual traditions have developed various practices
to help individuals access this state of dis-embedding. These practices
include rituals, prayers, collective hymn singing, worship in grand
cathedrals, use of drugs, and most effectively, meditation-like
techniques. These practices aim to quieten the thinking mind and provide
a taste of the altered state that arises when an individual is not
embedded in thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>The traditions’ claim to validity often hinges on the profound
experiences associated with these states. They suggest that these
experiences serve as strong evidence for the correctness of their
supernatural beliefs. However, to be taken seriously, these traditions
must not only talk about these states but also provide methods for their
followers to experience them.</p>
<p>In summary, the passage explores the idea of dis-embedding from
thoughts and emotions, a state often pursued in religious and spiritual
contexts. This state is compared to awakening from a dream, offering a
broader perspective that can reveal the absurdity or lack of sense in
one’s previous behavior. Various practices, particularly meditation-like
techniques, are used by these traditions to facilitate access to this
state. The traditions’ validity is often tied to the profound
experiences associated with this state, which they present as evidence
for their supernatural beliefs.</p>
<p>The text discusses the development of skills to enable metasystemic
cognition, which involves enhancing one’s agency and cognitive capacity
through extended dis-embedding practices. These practices are based on
core principles from religious and spiritual traditions but can be
modified and enhanced for specific purposes.</p>
<p>The author emphasizes that reading about these practices is not
enough; one must experiment and practice them to truly understand and
benefit from them. This process involves trial-and-error, persistence,
and continuous evaluation of attempts against their intended
effects.</p>
<p>The key to mastering these practices is to find a reliable feedback
mechanism. This could be a specific feeling in the body or a ‘shape’ to
movements that indicate correct execution. The author suggests that an
effective guide would provide indicators for each key movement, then for
combinations of these movements, creating a hierarchy of feedback.</p>
<p>The core disengaging practice involves surrendering intentions at
certain points, but ultimately, the goal is to take control of one’s
practices. The author warns against relying solely on guided meditations
available online and encourages moving towards self-directed
practices.</p>
<p>In summary, the process of developing these skills involves:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Understanding the principles: Familiarize yourself with the core
concepts and principles from religious and spiritual traditions that
underpin these practices.</p></li>
<li><p>Experimentation: Try different methods and approaches to find
what works best for you. This could involve guided meditations,
mindfulness exercises, or other techniques.</p></li>
<li><p>Persistence: Stick with the practice despite initial challenges
or lack of immediate results. Improvement often comes gradually over
time.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluation: Regularly assess your progress by observing the
effects of the practice on your cognitive abilities and sense of agency.
This could involve noticing improvements in focus, decision-making,
creativity, or other relevant areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Feedback Mechanism: Develop a reliable way to gauge your
performance. This could be a physical sensation, a mental state, or an
observed change in behavior that indicates correct execution of the
practice.</p></li>
<li><p>Self-directed Practice: While guided exercises can be helpful
initially, the ultimate goal is to transition to self-directed practices
where you take control and tailor the experience to your needs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The text discusses methods for developing skills that enable
metasystemic cognition, which involves accessing all intellectual,
emotional, and physical resources to enhance agency and cognitive
abilities. The process is rooted in practices that promote dis-embedding
from immediate situations and focusing on the source of awareness within
oneself.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Dis-embedding: This involves breaking free from constant
engagement with external events, which often leads to forgetfulness of
one’s larger intentions. Dis-embedding can be achieved through practices
such as mindfulness, meditation, or other techniques that help focus
attention inward.</p></li>
<li><p>Focusing on the source of awareness: The first step towards
experiencing self-remembering is to dis-embed and focus attention on the
source of awareness within the head. This can be done by concentrating
on the point where thoughts and feelings arise, often described as a
subtle sensation or a “point of presence.”</p></li>
<li><p>Expanding awareness: After focusing on the source of awareness,
expand this attention to include the entire body and its three
centers—intellectual, emotional, and physical. This can be done by
sensing each center within the space of awareness within the body. For
instance, one might focus on the feeling of thoughts (intellectual),
emotions (emotional), and physical sensations (physical).</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporating the environment: Expand awareness further to
include the spacious environment surrounding the body. This step aims to
create a sense of being an intentional being within an expansive
environment, ready to act as needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Simultaneous self-awareness and environmental awareness: The
crucial final step is to focus part of dis-embedded attention
specifically on the body while simultaneously experiencing oneself as an
embodied being existing within a spacious environment. This dual focus
is intended to produce a direct realization that one is an intentional
being capable of acting upon larger intentions and goals.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhancing the experience: Deep, focused breathing can further
heighten awareness of the body and mind, intensifying the sense of “I
am” and the experience of being-in-the-world. This practice is likened
to rekindling dying embers in a fire, using breath to revitalize and
bring to life one’s inner sensations and awareness.</p></li>
<li><p>Self-remembering: Successfully executing these practices leads to
experiencing self-remembering—a powerful realization of one’s agency,
intentions, capabilities, and readiness to act within the world. This
experience contrasts with the typical human state of constant
embeddedness in external events, often resulting in forgetfulness of
larger intentions.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice and mastery: Developing these skills requires practice
and experimentation with various combinations of attention resting on
different aspects—head, emotions, physical sensations, or spacious
environment. Mastering these elements allows one to eventually combine
them in the described manner to achieve self-remembering.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, developing metasystemic cognition involves dis-embedding
from immediate situations, focusing on the source of awareness within
the body, expanding attention to include all three centers and the
surrounding environment, and ultimately realizing oneself as an
intentional being capable of acting upon larger intentions. This process
requires dedicated practice and experimentation to master these skills
effectively.</p>
<p>The text discusses the limitations of analytical/rational thinking in
modeling complex phenomena and introduces Otto Laske’s Thought Form
Framework as a tool to scaffold metasystemic cognition. This framework
identifies four categories or Quadrants of thought forms missing from
analytical/rational thinking: Context, Process, Relationship, and
‘Systems-in-Transformation’.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Context Quadrant: This quadrant deals with the broader context in
which complex phenomena occur. It includes thought forms such as
‘Historical Context’, ‘Cultural Context’, ‘Social Context’, ‘Physical
Environment’, ‘Temporal Context’, ‘Space and Place’, and ‘Unspoken
Assumptions’. These thought forms help thinkers consider the larger
context that influences a phenomenon, which is often overlooked in
analytical/rational models.</p></li>
<li><p>Process Quadrant: This quadrant focuses on the dynamic, unfolding
nature of complex phenomena. It includes thought forms like ‘Emergence’,
‘Self-Organization’, ‘Feedback Loops’, ‘Nonlinear Dynamics’,
‘Complexity’, ‘Unpredictability’, ‘Adaptation’, and ‘Transformation’.
These thought forms help thinkers capture the evolving, interconnected
aspects of complex systems that are not easily represented in static,
analytical models.</p></li>
<li><p>Relationship Quadrant: This quadrant emphasizes the
interconnections and interdependencies among elements within a complex
system. It includes thought forms such as ‘Interdependence’, ‘Network
Effects’, ‘Ecosystems’, ‘Relationships and Connections’, ‘Synergy’,
‘Conflict and Tension’, ‘Power Dynamics’, and ‘Collaboration’. These
thought forms help thinkers understand the intricate web of
relationships that shape complex phenomena, which are often ignored or
oversimplified in analytical/rational models.</p></li>
<li><p>Systems-in-Transformation Quadrant: This quadrant draws attention
to the dynamic, evolving nature of complex systems and how they change
over time. It includes thought forms like ‘Evolution’,
‘Transformations’, ‘Transitions’, ‘Leverage Points’, ‘Tipping Points’,
‘Resilience’, ‘Vulnerability’, and ‘Anticipation’. These thought forms
help thinkers model complex phenomena as they evolve and transform,
capturing the temporal aspect that is often missing in static analytical
models.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The text suggests that these Quadrants should not be used in
isolation but integrated together to model complex, dynamic phenomena
adequately. It also mentions that users can develop new thought forms as
needed when modeling specific complex phenomena. The Thought Form
Framework aims to help analytical/rational thinkers identify and
incorporate missing aspects of reality into their models, facilitating
the transition from analytical/rational thinking to metasystemic
cognition.</p>
<p>The text discusses the limitations of analytical/rational thinking in
understanding complex phenomena, particularly those that are constantly
changing. This type of thinking struggles with representing processes
that are continually evolving, as they may not fit initial definitions
due to significant changes over time. The Process Quadrant thought forms
aim to address these limitations by drawing attention to the need to
consider and model such processes.</p>
<p>Three Process thought forms are highlighted: TF#1, TF#2, and
TF#6.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>TF#1 emphasizes the ceaseless movement and change in reality. It
suggests that there are no permanent objects or things; instead,
everything is a process that emerges, exists, and eventually disappears.
For instance, a mountain range is not a static entity but a process that
forms, persists, and may even erode away over time. This thought form
encourages thinkers to view reality as dynamic and ever-changing, rather
than as static objects.</p></li>
<li><p>TF#2 focuses on the interconnectedness of processes within
complex systems. It highlights that processes do not exist in isolation
but are intertwined with other processes, creating a web of
relationships. This thought form underscores the importance of
understanding how different processes interact and influence one another
within a system. By recognizing these connections, thinkers can develop
more comprehensive models that account for the complex interplay of
various processes.</p></li>
<li><p>TF#6 deals with the concept of emergence in complex systems. It
explains that new properties or patterns can arise from the interaction
of simpler processes, which may not be predictable solely based on the
properties of individual components. This thought form emphasizes the
value of examining how processes combine to generate novel
characteristics and behaviors at higher levels of organization. By
acknowledging emergence, thinkers can better appreciate the
unpredictability and complexity that arise from the interactions of
multiple processes within a system.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These Process thought forms serve as scaffolds for thinkers to
recognize and incorporate patterns and processes into their models
effectively. They encourage a shift away from rigid, analytical thinking
towards a more dynamic and holistic understanding of complex phenomena.
By embracing these thought forms, thinkers can develop more accurate and
insightful models that capture the ever-changing nature of reality.</p>
<p>The text discusses the development of metasystemic thinking, which
involves understanding and modeling complex reality. It emphasizes that
simply reading about the Quadrants (systems for categorizing knowledge)
and Thought Forms (mental tools for building models) is not enough to
become a metasystemic thinker. Declarative knowledge alone does not
install mental skills required for model-building.</p>
<p>The text critiques postmodernism, noting that while it effectively
critiques analytical/rational thinking, it has failed to develop a new,
higher level of cognition capable of understanding dynamic, complex
phenomena. It argues that postmodernism has not generated a new kind of
science or effective models of complex reality.</p>
<p>The author stresses that the real work begins when one starts
practicing model-building skills persistently and indefatigably. The
specific nature of these skills cannot be precisely specified, making
experimentation and play using thought forms essential. This
experimentation can be guided by assessing whether the skills enable
accurate predictions in models.</p>
<p>The text introduces three main Quadrants: Systems for Categorizing
Knowledge (which includes the four systems mentioned earlier), Mental
Tools for Building Models (Thought Forms), and Skills for Building
Models. Each Quadrant has several levels, and mastering them requires
continuous practice and experimentation.</p>
<p>The text also introduces three Thought Form Frameworks: Dialectical,
Holistic-Systemic, and Metasystemic. These frameworks help identify
mental skills needed for model-building. The Dialectical Framework
focuses on understanding the limitations of analytical/rational
thinking, while the Holistic-Systemic Framework emphasizes
interconnectedness and emergence. The Metasystemic Framework deals with
understanding and modeling complex systems at multiple levels of
abstraction.</p>
<p>In summary, the text argues that becoming a metasystemic thinker
requires more than just understanding theoretical concepts; it demands
persistent practice and experimentation using mental tools and skills to
build accurate models of complex reality.</p>
<p>The passage discusses the process of developing metasystemic
cognition and beyond, focusing on self-scaffolding and continuous
improvement. Here’s a detailed summary and explanation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Model Development</strong>: The first step involves
creating complex models from first principles about a specific
phenomenon. This requires conscious effort and the use of the Quadrants
and thought forms to identify dynamic patterns.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model Testing</strong>: After developing a model, it’s
crucial to test it against existing knowledge about the phenomenon. This
helps identify where the model is deficient or inadequate. The goal is
not to find a perfect model but to understand its limitations and areas
for improvement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model Amendment</strong>: Based on the testing, the model
should be amended to ensure its predictions are consistent with existing
knowledge. If the new model makes predictions that conflict with
existing knowledge, it may indicate that the new model includes relevant
elements missing from previous models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meta-Model and Meta-Strategy Examination</strong>: The
process doesn’t stop at model improvement; it also involves examining
and amending meta-models (the models used to generate other models) and
associated meta-strategies. This is crucial for enhancing one’s capacity
to build complex models in general, not just for the specific phenomenon
being investigated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meta Mind-Opening Questions</strong>: The key questions
to ask oneself during this process are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did my meta-models fail to develop an effective model in
specific instances?</li>
<li>How can my meta-models and associated strategies be amended to avoid
such mistakes in the future?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Use of Quadrants and Thought Forms</strong>: Throughout
this process, the Quadrants and thought forms are essential tools for
identifying deficiencies in models and strategies, as well as for
guiding their improvement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Goal of Self-Redundancy</strong>: The ultimate goal is to
make oneself redundant as a cognitive coach or therapist by enabling the
subject to apply therapeutic or modeling tools to themselves
indefinitely. This requires effortful work on oneself, learning from
failures and challenges, and continuous improvement of cognitive
strategies and skills.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In essence, this process is about recursive development - continually
improving models and strategies based on testing, feedback, and
self-reflection. It’s a journey towards metasystemic cognition and
beyond, where one can generate complex models and cognitive strategies
from first principles, and continuously refine them based on
self-assessment and existing knowledge.</p>
<p>The provided text is a glossary or index of terms related to
evolution, cognition, consciousness, and management theory. Here’s a
summary and explanation of some key concepts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Evolution: The process of change and development over time. In
this context, it refers to a unified theory that explains the emergence
of global entities, integration and cooperation increases, and the
evolution of sexual reproduction. It also discusses the trajectory of
evolution, including potential paths on other planets.</p></li>
<li><p>Complexity Science: A field of study that focuses on
understanding complex systems, which are systems with many
interconnected parts that can produce unexpected outcomes or emergent
properties. This science is mentioned in relation to cognition and
evolution.</p></li>
<li><p>Cognition: Mental processes involved in gaining knowledge and
understanding through thought, experience, and the senses. Vertical
differences refer to variations in cognitive abilities across
individuals or species.</p></li>
<li><p>Conscious Evolution: The intentional direction of evolution by
conscious agents. This concept is mentioned in relation to conscious
evolution, which involves actively shaping our own evolution and that of
society and the planet.</p></li>
<li><p>Consciousness: A state of awareness and perception of one’s
surroundings, thoughts, and feelings. The text discusses future
evolution of consciousness and explains it as a problem of
causation.</p></li>
<li><p>Cooperation: Working together for a common goal or benefit. In
evolutionary terms, cooperation is discussed in relation to group
selectionism, the idea that natural selection can act on groups of
organisms rather than just individual organisms. The text also mentions
the cooperation barrier, which refers to challenges in achieving and
maintaining cooperative behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>Evolutionary Management Theory: A framework for understanding and
managing complex systems, such as organizations or societies, using
principles from evolutionary biology. It includes concepts like external
management (managing through rules and structures) and internal
management (self-organizing and self-regulating).</p></li>
<li><p>Evolvability: The capacity of a system to evolve or change in
response to selection pressures. The text discusses the evolution of
evolvability, including major transitions and its role in increasing
integration and cooperation.</p></li>
<li><p>Existential Questions: Deep philosophical questions about the
nature of existence, reality, and our place in the universe. The text
mentions existential questions in relation to answers that provide
insight into these profound issues.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The text provided appears to be an index or glossary of terms related
to various philosophical, scientific, and cognitive concepts. Here’s a
detailed summary and explanation of some key topics and terms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Metasystem Transition (MST)</strong>: This term refers to
a significant shift in the way a system organizes itself, leading to a
higher level of complexity and integration. It’s often associated with
the Second Enlightenment, a proposed period of intellectual and cultural
transformation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Second Enlightenment</strong>: This concept suggests a
new phase in human understanding, characterized by the development of
metasystemic cognition – the ability to think about thinking at higher
levels of abstraction. It’s seen as a response to the limitations of
traditional enlightenment thinking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Metasystemic Cognition</strong>: This is a form of
thinking that allows for recursive self-improvement and the creation of
more complex systems. It involves seeing thinking as an object, which
can then be improved upon. This concept is central to the Second
Enlightenment and the development of metasystem transition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recursive Self-Improvement</strong>: This term refers to
the process of using analytical/rational thinking to improve cognitive
abilities, leading to a feedback loop where improved thinking leads to
further improvements. It’s a key aspect of metasystemic cognition and
recursive self-improvement in AI.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-Evolving Beings</strong>: These are entities capable
of autonomous development and improvement, often associated with the
concept of metasystem transition. They’re characterized by their ability
to reflect on their own processes and make changes based on that
reflection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scaffolding Program</strong>: This seems to be a method
or practice aimed at facilitating personal growth and development. It
involves creating structures or ‘scaffolds’ to support and guide the
process of self-improvement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vertical Development</strong>: This term, often
associated with Robert Kegan’s model, refers to the progression through
stages of mental development, each characterized by a more complex and
integrated way of understanding the world.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Systems Science</strong>: This is an interdisciplinary
field that studies how parts of a system interact to produce the
properties of the whole. It’s concerned with understanding complex
systems and their behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simulation Hypotheses</strong>: These are theories
suggesting that our reality might be a simulation, often proposed in the
context of advanced civilizations or artificial intelligence. They’re
explored in the text as potential explanations for certain
phenomena.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tragedy of the Commons</strong>: This is a scenario in
which individuals, acting independently and rationally according to
their self-interest, deplete a shared resource, leading to a loss for
all. It’s a concept from game theory and environmental science.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The text also includes references to various thinkers and theories,
such as Alfred North Whitehead, Ken Wilber, Rudolf Steiner, and Robert
Kegan, among others. These figures contribute to the broader
intellectual context of the concepts discussed.</p>
